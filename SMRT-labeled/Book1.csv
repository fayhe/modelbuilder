Forum,Safety/Accident,,"Referring to the letters, ""Circle Line train incident: SMRT explains cause and steps taken"" and ""Commuters distressed and kept in the dark"", forum writer “Larry Chong Tuck Lai” asked several questions regarding the safety of passengers when there is smoke inside the train. 

These are the questions, assuming a fully packed peak-hour train:
• How much smoke is needed before the smoke detector is activated and the ventilation system shut?
• What happens after the ventilation system is shut?
• How long will the air supply last in a crowded train with no air-conditioning or ventilation and with the presence of smoke in the cabin?
• While the incident was resolved within five minutes, what happens if we have a case where staff are unable to reach the site of the breakdown for hours, and the system is not restored?
• What options are available to passengers trapped in the train?
• Are there manual systems to allow passengers to free themselves, or at least open windows to allow air to flow in?

CIC/CMC is working with SMRT Trains to prepare a response.

SMRT Buses,Customer Service ,Positive ,"Four new bus routes in Choa Chu Kang, Punggol and Queenstown will be introduced by March 2015, announced the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Monday (Jan 5). Details of the new routes are currently being worked on, the LTA added. The new bus routes are part of the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP), which was first announced in 2012. In a joint news release with SMRT and SBS Transit, the LTA said that 550 Government-funded buses have been rolled out under the programme as of Dec 31, 2014.

SMRT Bus service 920 has been cited to now run at nine-to-ten minute intervals during morning peak period, compared with 14 to 16 minutes previously. SBS Transit and SMRT have also improved 12 bus services in this quarter by deploying higher-capacity buses or adding more bus trips along sectors that experience heavy ridership.

LTA said that PTOs will be required to deliver higher service standards. Under BSEP, 95 per cent of feeder services are required to operate at 10 minutes intervals during the morning and evening peak by 2014, this will be tightened to 100 per cent by eight-minute intervals by 2017.

Forum,Repair/Maintenance ,,"In a reply by Mr Chia Chun Wah, Vice-President, Circle Line & Bukit Panjang Light Rail Transit, SMRT Corporation to the letter from Mr Larry Chong Tuck Lai, ""How can passengers help themselves in a train breakdown?"", Mr Chia clarified the safety measures in place for the Circle Line Trains. The letter is reproduced below.

There are smoke detectors similar to those found in buildings, installed in each Circle Line train cabin. When external smoke is detected, air intake will shut to shield the cabin from smoke. But when internal smoke is detected, the exhaust air vent will be opened to expel air into the tunnel. 

Our Operations Control Centre, which monitors Circle Line trains at all times, observes strict procedures under a Rail Incident Management Plan. This plan places the highest priority on the safety and well-being of passengers during rail incidents.

When a train is unresponsive to the Operations Control Centre's attempts to resume service, station staff will be sent immediately to attend to passengers on board the stalled vehicle. Even at the longest stretch between Circle Line stations, station staff could reach the train within minutes via service walkways located alongside the tracks. The ability of staff to respond quickly and effectively to such incidents is tested regularly.

Public transport operators are required to clear passengers from stalled trains within half an hour. Ventilation systems will continue operating for more than 45 minutes during such situations. As an additional safeguard, doors in each cabin have emergency handles to allow passengers to open them to improve airflow and ventilation.

Our first priority will be to recover stalled trains as quickly as possible and to enable passengers to detrain at the nearest station.

An immobile train can be “pushed out” with the assistance of another train. This procedure allows passengers to resume their journey from the next station. It also allows the stalled train to be cleared from the track so that trains behind it can continue with their journey.

As a precaution, whenever there is a detrainment involving the movement of passengers to the track, emergency services will assist SMRT with the evacuation.

We hope this explanation reassures commuters like Mr Chong of SMRT’s comprehensive safety and security measures in place for all passengers who journey with us.

SMRT Corporate,CSR,Positive ,"Rail infrastructure enhancements - including the expansion of the rail network and major upgrades to existing lines - have signalled the need for technicians to maintain the train system here. To meet the growing demand, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) will offer a two-year Higher Nitec course in rapid transit engineering this April. 

It is one of three new Higher Nitec courses ITE is introducing this year, which can be taken by those who have a related Nitec certificate or who scored at least E8 in three relevant O-level subjects. A pioneer cohort of 40 students will attend classes at ITE College West in Choa Chu Kang, where they will be trained in the maintenance of rail communications equipment, such as train intercoms and closed circuit television cameras and signalling systems that help trains run more frequently, among others. In the final semester, students will serve a three-month attachment with rail operators SMRT and SBS Transit and engineering firms in the rapid transit sector. 

Graduates can take on jobs with train operators and engineering firms as technicians and technical officers.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"A Wednesday morning slowdown on MRT train service on the East-West line was caused by a door fault, said SMRT.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"Wanbao carried an article with the picture of the damaged earrings that caused delayed travelling times for commuters travelling eastbound along the East-West Line.

The reporter speculated that the earring could have been shattered into the three pieces we see in the picture due to the compression force of the closing door, or crushed by unaware passengers.

An unnamed SMRT technician told Wanbao that it is the first time that such incident has occurred and that small items lodged along the door tracks are usually very difficult to extract. The technician also mentioned that the chances of small items falling into the door tracks were very slim. The technician also explained that when train doors close and open repeatedly, it usually means that the train system has detected that a door was not fully closed. The train captain will usually attempt to close the door again to ensure doors are fully shut before departing.

The reporter mentioned that a similar incident that took place at Redhill MRT station on Jan 24, 2014.

SMRT Trains,Regulations,Neutral ,"Train commuters can expect up to 25 per cent shorter wait times next year, particularly during peak periods with new measures announced by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Thursday (Jan 15). 
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is also introducing new service standards this year: One on the frequency of severe service delays where trains are running but at significantly reduced speeds for over an hour, and one on the time it takes for trains to travel from one end of the line to the other.
The North-South Line (NSL), North-East Line (NEL) and Circle Line (CCL) will be the first to come under the new operating standards on frequency next year. During morning peak hours on the NSL, trains will be expected to arrive every 100 seconds, instead of the current 120 to 180 seconds. On the NEL, trains must arrive every 120 seconds, down from 160 seconds, while on the CCL, they must arrive every 160 seconds, from the current 210 seconds.
New standards for the East West Line — expected to arrive every 110 seconds from every 120 to 180 seconds — will kick in 2018, as the upgrade to its signalling system will only be ready then. To ensure public transport operators can meet these standards, the LTA will also require the operators to maximise the number of trains available in their expanded fleets — at least 90 per cent — for service during morning peak periods
Announcing the timeline at a media briefing yesterday, LTA Chief Executive Chew Men Leong said the move is in anticipation of increased train capacity. More new trains are set to be injected — 18 for the NEL and 24 for the CCL from this year, and 28 for the NSEWL from 2016.
When asked why the CCL will have lower frequencies than the rest, Mr Chew said the timings are sufficient to meet projected demand. But this will be reviewed when the full length of the CCL is completed, he added.
In response to the new standards, Ms Tammy Tan, SBS Transit’s Senior Vice-President of Corporate Communications, said the operator is working closely with LTA on the proposed changes. “We always have and will continue to work hard at improving our level of service to commuters,” she said.
MD SMR Trains, Mr Lee Ling Wee, said SMRT would continue to do its best to meet the new standards. He added that they have made good progress in the past year to upgrade infrastructure, particularly in its re-sleepering efforts on the NSL and efforts will continue over the next few years.

SMRT Trains,Regulations,Neutral ,"Train commuters can expect up to 25 per cent shorter wait times next year, particularly during peak periods with new measures announced by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Thursday (Jan 15). 
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is also introducing new service standards this year: One on the frequency of severe service delays where trains are running but at significantly reduced speeds for over an hour, and one on the time it takes for trains to travel from one end of the line to the other.
The North-South Line (NSL), North-East Line (NEL) and Circle Line (CCL) will be the first to come under the new operating standards on frequency next year. During morning peak hours on the NSL, trains will be expected to arrive every 100 seconds, instead of the current 120 to 180 seconds. On the NEL, trains must arrive every 120 seconds, down from 160 seconds, while on the CCL, they must arrive every 160 seconds, from the current 210 seconds.
New standards for the East West Line — expected to arrive every 110 seconds from every 120 to 180 seconds — will kick in 2018, as the upgrade to its signalling system will only be ready then. To ensure public transport operators can meet these standards, the LTA will also require the operators to maximise the number of trains available in their expanded fleets — at least 90 per cent — for service during morning peak periods
Announcing the timeline at a media briefing yesterday, LTA Chief Executive Chew Men Leong said the move is in anticipation of increased train capacity. More new trains are set to be injected — 18 for the NEL and 24 for the CCL from this year, and 28 for the NSEWL from 2016.
When asked why the CCL will have lower frequencies than the rest, Mr Chew said the timings are sufficient to meet projected demand. But this will be reviewed when the full length of the CCL is completed, he added.
In response to the new standards, Ms Tammy Tan, SBS Transit’s Senior Vice-President of Corporate Communications, said the operator is working closely with LTA on the proposed changes. “We always have and will continue to work hard at improving our level of service to commuters,” she said.

SMRT Corporate,CSR,Neutral ,"Singapore must step up its game on collecting and utilising big data to achieve its goal of being a smart city, said Professor Chan Heng Chee, who heads the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities (LKYCIC). The centre, which is part of the Singapore University of Technology and Design, will hold its first round-table of thought leaders on innovation in cities in Singapore next Monday and Tuesday, Jan 19-20.

In an interview with The Straits Times, Prof Chan, who is LKYCIC chairman and ambassador-at-large, said the focus of the discussion will be how big data can aid in the development of smart cities such as Singapore. The closed-door round-table will have an audience of about 70, comprising academics, bureaucrats, and representatives from organisations such as public transport operator SMRT, the new Smart Nation Programme Office, Keppel Corp and DBS Bank.

Forum,Safety/Accident,Negative,"Forum writer “Xu Wen Fong” shared that he has been afraid to taking SMRT bus service 811, especially when it is driven by a particular middle-aged bus captain. He commented that the bus captain would accelerate rapidly and brake hard at traffic lights. He urged SMRT to remind bus captains that safety comes first."
Taxi,CSR,Positive ,"More than 100 projects have received grants from the SG50 Celebration Fund, launched last year to encourage Singaporeans to come up with novel ways to celebrate SG50. The article highlights six noteworthy projects, including Wheels@Ubin.

Wheels@Ubin is a project to bring 100 wheelchair-users to Pulau Ubin. Realising that Pulau Ubin is inaccessible to wheelchair-users, Dennis Quek and Wilson Ang decided to do something about it. They approached SMRT Taxis for assistance to drive the wheelchair-users to Changi Jetty as well as the Singapore Navy for help to ferry the wheelchair-users over to the island.

SMRT Trains,Facilities ,Positive ,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is taking steps to make it harder for intruders to gain access to MRT tracks. Last month, it called a tender for anti-climb barriers to be built at the Redhill MRT Station. Topped with razor blades, the 3m-high fence will be built at the top of the Redhill MRT tunnel portal, and will prevent intruders from climbing down onto the tracks. Redhill MRT Station is the first station where these new barriers are being rolled out. The LTA said similar barriers will be installed at other stations but declined to reveal which ones. A total of 177 track intrusions have been recorded on the MRT network since 2003. 

The LTA is also looking to implement security screens at selected overhead pedestrian bridges next to MRT tracks, meant to prevent foreign objects from being thrown onto the tracks. Although there have not been any such cases, LTA is taking pre-emptive steps. Mr Patrick Nathan, Vice-President of Corporate Information and Communications at SMRT, said that last year, our train staff found about 200 foreign objects on our tracks. The items, which ranged from mobile devices, wallets and shoes to pieces of cardboard and clothing, were small and did not compromise train operations.

Member of Parliament Cedric Foo, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, believes the enhancements will strengthen the integrity of the MRT network.

SMRT Trains,Commuter Behaviour ,Negative,"Netizen Alice shared on STOMP that she came across a man who smoked openly in a train carriage and even threw his cigarette butt on the train floor while on an East-West Line train at Tanjong Pagar MRT station on Jan 13. It is understood that SMRT and the National Environment Agency have been informed of the incident, and it is believed that investigations are on-going."
SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"Hundreds of thousands of people take the trains daily. But all it takes is a small object like an earring or someone’s toe to stall trains. Last Wednesday at about 8am, train services along the East West Line were delayed after an east-bound train travelling from Joo Koon to Dover encountered a door fault. Passengers at Chinese Garden Station were asked to alight and board two additionally deployed trains to continue their journey. SMRT technicians later retrieved an earring and two beads, each with a diameter of about 1cm, which had obstructed the doors, said an SMRT spokesman.

Mr Patrick Nathan, Vice-President of Corporate Information and Communications at SMRT said the train will not move off unless the doors are shut. Mr Nathan said that this is a basic safety design feature, and added that small objects usually fall through the gaps provided for in the door guides so that train doors can be safely closed. If any of the doors are not closed within a certain safety tolerance, the train will not be able to move off. Mr Nathan also reminded commuters to be careful about their belongings and to keep clear of train doors as they are closing. 

Senior Vice-President of Corporate Communications at SBS Transit said that similar incidents have happened on the North-East Line, but noted that these are isolated cases. Ms Tay also said that some of these items include dry cell batteries, hair clips and pins and other miscellaneous small items.

SMRT Buses,Facilities ,Positive ,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has received bids from 11 companies for its inaugural public bus contract, signalling strong interest in a business that has long been deemed to be barely profitable. By the time the tender for the Bulim package of 26 routes closed at noon yesterday, four local companies and six foreign players had submitted their bids. There was also one joint bid from a local and foreign operator. The local bidders are Aedge Holdings and Woodlands Transport, as well as incumbents SBS Transit and SMRT Corp. The foreign entities are Busways (Australia), Jinan Public Transportation Corp (China), Keolis (France), RATP Dev Transdev (France), Go-Ahead (Britain) and Tower Transit (Australia).

While the tender evaluation is under way, The Straits Times understands the LTA is already preparing to put two more route packages up for bidding – one in Mandai and the other in Loyang.

Separately, SBS Transit and SMRT will have nine route packages to run when their current operating licences expire in August next year. When the nine expire in 2021, the two must jostle for rights to run them thereafter, like everyone else.

VP of SMRT Buses, Mr Tan Kian Heong said: “Having closely examined the Bulim package, we are confident that on the combined strength of our management, workforce and processes, we will exceed the performance and service expectations outlined in the tender. SMRT Buses looks forward to delivering a positive commuter experience to all residents served by the Bulim bus services.”

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"Train services on the North-South Line from Admiralty to Yishun were delayed by 20 minutes on Monday afternoon, Jan 20. This was due to a problem with the ""third rail"", which supplies power to the trains, operator SMRT said on its Facebook page. Apologising for the inconvenience, SMRT said bus bridging services were activated between the two MRT stations, and that its engineers were on site to fix the fault. At 3.32pm, SMRT updated in a tweet that the affected train service had resumed."
SMRT Buses,Facilities ,Neutral ,"These are delayed coverage on the closing of the bus tender reported yesterday. 

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has received bids from 11 companies for its inaugural public bus contract, signalling strong interest in a business that has long been deemed to be barely profitable. By the time the tender for the Bulim package of 26 routes closed at noon yesterday, four local companies and six foreign players had submitted their bids. There was also one joint bid from a local and foreign operator. The local bidders are Aedge Holdings and Woodlands Transport, as well as incumbents SBS Transit and SMRT Corp. The foreign entities are Busways (Australia), Jinan Public Transportation Corp (China), Keolis (France), RATP Dev Transdev (France), Go-Ahead (Britain) and Tower Transit (Australia).

While the tender evaluation is under way, The Straits Times understands the LTA is already preparing to put two more route packages up for bidding – one in Mandai and the other in Loyang.

Separately, SBS Transit and SMRT will have nine route packages to run when their current operating licenses expire in August next year. When the nine expire in 2021, the two must jostle for rights to run them thereafter, like everyone else.

SMRT Corporate,Fares,Neutral ,"These are delayed coverage on Minister Lui Tuck Yew’s statements in Parliament on Monday.

Commuters may see a potential drop in fares next year, given the drop in energy prices last year. Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew laid out this possibility in Parliament on 19 Jan, pointing out that the decline in last year’s energy and fuel prices “could possible translate to a negative fare adjustment”, to the tune of around negative 1 per cent, based on available data thus far. 

The 2015 fare review exercise, which will occur at the end of this year, will use indices in 2014. Mr Lui was responding to a question by Mr Gan Thiam Poh, MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, on whether the ongoing fare review exercise will consider a reduction in transport fares due to the fall in oil prices. 

Mr Lui said that the ongoing fare review exercise had yielded a negative 0.6 per cent fare adjustment quantum, he added: “Supposing we had implemented the full 6.6 per cent fare adjustment quantum in the previous fare review exercise (last January) and we did not carry over the 3.4 per cent, then indeed we would have a fare adjustment for this year that is negative 0.6 per cent. But because the remaining 3.4 per cent was carried over, the fare adjustment quantum in the current exercise will be 2.8 per cent instead.”

The current exercise began last November and its results are expected to be announced by the first quarter of this year.

SMRT Corporate,Fares,Neutral ,"There will be an overall increase of 2.8 per cent to public transport fares following the conclusion of the 2014 Fare Review Exercise, the Public Transport Council (PTC) announced on Wednesday, Jan 22. 

The 2.8 per cent figure was calculated by aggregating the 3.4 per cent fare adjustment quantum carried over from the 2013 Fare Review Exercise with the -0.6 per cent figure from 2014, said the PTC.  PTC Chairman Richard Magnus said that the 15-member council “made a concerted effort to minimise impact on commuters, even to the extent of insulating some from the increase altogether”. Mr Magnus said that, all things being equal, the oil price plunge will result in a 1 per cent decrease in fares next year. 

With the fare increments, the PTC said the two public transport operators – SBS Transit and SMRT – will have to contribute $5.5 million and $8 million, respectively, to the Public Transport Fund. The total of $13.5 million is $2 million more than their contribution last year. The Government will utilise the Public Transport Fund to provide Public Transport Vouchers to lower-income households to mitigate the increase in their travel expenditure, it added. ST reported that the size of the contributions or clawback hinges on the firm’s profitability and the formula allows for a clawback of up to 50 per cent.

Several news sources reported that SMRT is expected to reap S$26.6 million increase in revenue and a net increase of $18.6 million in revenue after contributions.

VP CIC, Mr Patrick Nathan, reiterated that it is important to strike the “right balance” between affordability of bus and train services, and business sustainability.

ST Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan provided an opinion piece on the issue, highlighting the divide between public perception versus reality in the fare hike, in summary, he opined that the existing method of using actual instead of projected figures to calculate fare adjustment is “quite sound” despite inherent time lag between review and implementation. This method would also prevent major projection errors by policymakers and avoid the “flip-flop” seen in the projection method of calculating COE supplies based on the number of cars to be scrapped in a given year.

SMRT Corporate,Fares,Neutral ,"There will be an overall increase of 2.8 per cent to public transport fares following the conclusion of the 2014 Fare Review Exercise, the Public Transport Council (PTC) announced on Wednesday, Jan 22. 

The 2.8 per cent figure was calculated by aggregating the 3.4 per cent fare adjustment quantum carried over from the 2013 Fare Review Exercise with the -0.6 per cent figure from 2014, said the PTC.  PTC Chairman Richard Magnus said that the 15-member council “made a concerted effort to minimise impact on commuters, even to the extent of insulating some from the increase altogether”. Mr Magnus said that, all things being equal, the oil price plunge will result in a 1 per cent decrease in fares next year. 

With the fare increments, the PTC said the two public transport operators – SBS Transit and SMRT – will have to contribute $5.5 million and $8 million, respectively, to the Public Transport Fund. The total of $13.5 million is $2 million more than their contribution last year. The Government will utilise the Public Transport Fund to provide Public Transport Vouchers to lower-income households to mitigate the increase in their travel expenditure, it added. ST reported that the size of the contributions or clawback hinges on the firm’s profitability and the formula allows for a clawback of up to 50 per cent.

Several news sources reported that SMRT is expected to reap S$26.6 million increase in revenue and a net increase of $18.6 million in revenue after contributions.

VP CIC, Mr Patrick Nathan, reiterated that it is important to strike the “right balance” between affordability of bus and train services, and business sustainability.

ST Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan provided an opinion piece on the issue, highlighting the divide between public perception versus reality in the fare hike, in summary, he opined that the existing method of using actual instead of projected figures to calculate fare adjustment is “quite sound” despite inherent time lag between review and implementation. This method would also prevent major projection errors by policymakers and avoid the “flip-flop” seen in the projection method of calculating COE supplies based on the number of cars to be scrapped in a given year.

The 2.8 per cent figure was calculated by aggregating the 3.4 per cent fare adjustment quantum carried over from the 2013 Fare Review Exercise with the -0.6 per cent figure from 2014, said the PTC.  PTC Chairman Richard Magnus said that the 15-member council “made a concerted effort to minimise impact on commuters, even to the extent of insulating some from the increase altogether”. Mr Magnus said that, all things being equal, the oil price plunge will result in a 1 per cent decrease in fares next year. 

With the fare increments, the PTC said the two public transport operators – SBS Transit and SMRT – will have to contribute $5.5 million and $8 million, respectively, to the Public Transport Fund. The total of $13.5 million is $2 million more than their contribution last year. The Government will utilise the Public Transport Fund to provide Public Transport Vouchers to lower-income households to mitigate the increase in their travel expenditure, it added. ST reported that the size of the contributions or clawback hinges on the firm’s profitability and the formula allows for a clawback of up to 50 per cent.

Several news sources reported that SMRT is expected to reap S$26.6 million increase in revenue and a net increase of $18.6 million in revenue after contributions.

VP CIC, Mr Patrick Nathan, reiterated that it is important to strike the “right balance” between affordability of bus and train services, and business sustainability.

ST Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan provided an opinion piece on the issue, highlighting the divide between public perception versus reality in the fare hike, in summary, he opined that the existing method of using actual instead of projected figures to calculate fare adjustment is “quite sound” despite inherent time lag between review and implementation. This method would also prevent major projection errors by policymakers and avoid the “flip-flop” seen in the projection method of calculating COE supplies based on the number of cars to be scrapped in a given year.

This is to finance 250,000 public transport vouchers worth $30 each.

SMRT Corporate,Fares,Positive ,"These were the extended discussions on the recently announced fare hikes. Several media agencies created useful infographics depicting the key changes, interviewed the public and organised live discussions, soliciting views from commuters.

In response to the 2.8% fare hike amid falling global oil prices, most readers interviewed by Wanbao claimed that it is unacceptable and untimely. However, experts explained that the data used to calculate this fare hike was from two years ago and there will be some delay for the recent fall in oil prices to be reflected in the fare. In addition, the effect of oil price is relatively small as it only constitute 20% of the fare calculation according to the Energy Index.

93.8Live dedicated a half hour segment to take calls from the public and hear some of their opinions – While the hosts argue that higher fares are necessary to provide better service, one caller argued that he has not seen improved service and some hoped that the fare hikes will translate to better pay for transportation workers and not channelled just to senior management. Another caller requested more transparency from transport operators on the non-fare businesses such as the revenue derived from media spaces on buses at train stations. The hosts, citing figures from SMRT’s annual report, said that transport operators should look into informing the public on how calculations were made for the fare businesses. 

An editorial piece by Zaobao explained the fare review process to answer doubts on why public transport fares will be increasing by 2.8% instead of dropping after oil prices have fallen. It notes that the fare adjustment has taken care of the interest of disadvantaged group in Singapore, and the public has to be educated to dispel any misunderstandings about the fare adjustment.

Group revenue increased 6.8 per cent to S$313.2 million, outstripping total operating expenses which rose 4.2 per cent to S$295.9 million. Contributing to SMRT's improved performance was an increase in operating profit from train operations to S$3.2 million from S$0.4 million a year ago. The bus operations, meanwhile, slashed operating losses to S$0.5 million for the quarter from S$8.7 million previously, helped by higher revenue and productivity management efforts.
SMRT also managed to increase operating profits from rental business by 11.8 per cent to S$20.7 million, mainly due to higher rental renewal rates of commercial spaces.
Media coverage also highlighted the challenging business environment that SMRT continues to face, and how operating costs can be managed downwards next year with the adjustment in fares, lower energy costs and productivity and cost management efforts. 

Additionally, The Business Times also made reference to SMRT’s involvement in the recent bid submission for the first package of routes under the new bus contracting model.

Group revenue increased 6.8 per cent to S$313.2 million, outstripping total operating expenses which rose 4.2 per cent to S$295.9 million. Contributing to SMRT's improved performance was an increase in operating profit from train operations to S$3.2 million from S$0.4 million a year ago. The bus operations, meanwhile, slashed operating losses to S$0.5 million for the quarter from S$8.7 million previously, helped by higher revenue and productivity management efforts.
SMRT also managed to increase operating profits from rental business by 11.8 per cent to S$20.7 million, mainly due to higher rental renewal rates of commercial spaces.
Media coverage also highlighted the challenging business environment that SMRT continues to face, and how operating costs can be managed downwards next year with the adjustment in fares, lower energy costs and productivity and cost management efforts. 

Additionally, The Business Times also made reference to SMRT’s involvement in the recent bid submission for the first package of routes under the new bus contracting model.

Train service on the East-West line experienced delays during the evening rush hour on Tuesday same day due to track faults at two stations. In a tweet at 5.44pm, SMRT said there would be an estimated 20 minutes of additional travelling time from Tanjong Pagar to Jurong East towards Joo Koon.  In a statement to the media, the train operator said track faults at Clementi and Lakeside stations caused trains to travel at slower speed from Queenstown to Boon Lay. A free bus service between both stations was activated. The service resumed at 7.06pm.

In another media statement, SMRT said it has taken concrete steps to resolve the spate of train disruptions over the past week, even as it was hit by two rail incidents yesterday. SMRT said it was looking into the causes of yesterday's incidents, noting that the disruptions in the last week were unrelated. In a statement, the rail operator disclosed the results of its investigations and measures taken. Most dailies carried the quotes by MD Lee Ling Wee and President and Group CEO, Desmond Kuek.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"CNA reports the trending topic of #SMRTmovies, where netizens cleverly reworded famous movie titles to poke fun at the repeated MRT service disruptions."
,,,"Forum writer “Mr Han Jiajing” (""Shorten interval times of peak-hour trains""; Monday, Mar 2). He argued that before the fare increases were given approval to be raised, one would have expected train services to have improved. He opined that train services seem to be deteriorating instead and there seems to be no attempt to improve even the basics. 

He noticed that cabins are packed to the brim because trains arrive five to six minutes apart, and even the platforms get overcrowded, as a result, travelling on the older trains on the East-West Line is very uncomfortable, especially with the air-conditioning working only in some cabins.  He opined that the overcrowded conditions are a safety concern as well. After the free travel for peak hours was introduced, SMRT assured commuters that trains would arrive two to three minutes apart, he argued that the scenario did not materialise. Mr Han contended that although the Land Transport Authority has promised improvements, this would take another two more years to happen. In the meantime, the least SMRT could do is to ensure that train arrival times are improved and air-conditioning in the older trains are maintained at a comfortable level. He concluded that train fare increases would be justifiable only if there were such improvements.

Shin Min reported that these were part of five SMRT train disruption in nine days. Wanbao reported a total of six incidents in eight days, the sixth being a train stopping intermittently between Dhoby Ghaut and Newton on Feb 25.

Both articles carried the news of a woman suffering a fall from an escalator at Boon Lay MRT station, she was later sent to the hospital. The Land Transport Authority has ordered SMRT to investigate the incidents thoroughly and it will also be holding its own independent investigations as well.

Berita Harian carried the statements made by SMRT on the series of rail disruptions over the past week. The cause of each incident involving SMRT's network was different and technically unrelated, said the public transport operator in a statement on Tuesday, Mar 3. They carried factual information on each of the incidents mentioned in our media statement as well as quotes by President and Group CEO, Desmond Kuek.  In a separate article, BH also mentioned that the authorities are investigating the recent spate of train service disruptions on SMRT’s rail network and plan to review the operator’s resources and processes for maintaining the rail system.

,,,"Four forum letters were written in response to the article “Steps taken to fix series of train disruptions: SMRT”, which first appeared on ST, Mar 4.

Referring to the report, ""Steps taken to fix series of train disruptions: SMRT"", forum writer “Wong Weng Fai” said the public is upset that the annual fare increases do not seem to have translated into better service quality. Given the number and increasing frequency of the breakdowns, it is time to form a national, public, no holds barred, independent inquiry into the maintenance and operations, even construction, of the entire MRT system. He said that lessons learnt from a detailed investigation would be useful for future lines that Singapore is so heavily investing in and beneficial to any future entities that are selected to take over the current operations.

Referring to the report, ""Steps taken to fix series of train disruptions: SMRT"", forum writer “Patrick Tan Siong Kuan” said the SMRT's new management team has been in place for some time now and, yet, breakdowns and security lapses continue. As long as the MRT system is run by a profit-making organisation with a monopoly, the vested interests of shareholders and management will take precedence over those of commuters. The trust and confidence of commuters in SMRT have been eroded. If this continues, it may affect the confidence in the Land Transport Authority's sincerity and capability to fix the problem, added Mr Patrick Tan. He opines that it is time to acknowledge that the model has broken down.

Referring to the report, ""Steps taken to fix series of train disruptions: SMRT"", forum writer “Sum Siew Kee” said monetary penalties are insufficient to ""incentivise"" the operator's owners and managers to perform the necessary works. At least two of the disruptions last month were due to equipment failure. This may be because the fines only indirectly affect the company's bottom line. A fine only ""incentivises"" certain actions, but cannot ""compel"" the company to take certain action. He suggests that penalties for SMRT should be made in terms of voting rights and/or stock options instead of lump-sum fines and the threat of the public transport regulator exercising its right should be sufficient to compel the board of directors to act more defensively and to maintain the infrastructure adequately. He argued that in this way, the public will not be afraid that the fines will be “passed on” to consumers and give the regulator a direct say in how the transport operators conduct their maintenance procedures.

Referring to the report, “SMRT says sorry for ‘unacceptable’ disruptions”, forum writer “Dhanam Kuppusamy” who was affected by the train disruptions on Tueday, Mar 3, questioned how SMRT is going to compensate those commuters who took taxis due to the disruption.

At least two of the disruptions last month were due to equipment failure. This may be because the fines only indirectly affect the company's bottom line. A fine only ""incentivises"" certain actions, but cannot ""compel"" the company to take certain action. He suggests that penalties for SMRT should be made in terms of voting rights and/or stock options instead of lump-sum fines and the threat of the public transport regulator exercising its right should be sufficient to compel the board of directors to act more defensively and to maintain the infrastructure adequately. He argued that in this way, the public will not be afraid that the fines will be “passed on” to consumers and give the regulator a direct say in how the transport operators conduct their maintenance procedures.

Referring to the report, “SMRT says sorry for ‘unacceptable’ disruptions”, forum writer “Dhanam Kuppusamy” who was affected by the train disruptions on Tueday, Mar 3, questioned how SMRT is going to compensate those commuters who took taxis due to the disruption.

,,,"Four forum letters were written in response to the article “Steps taken to fix series of train disruptions: SMRT”, which first appeared on ST, Mar 4.

Referring to the report, ""Steps taken to fix series of train disruptions: SMRT"", forum writer “Wong Weng Fai” said the public is upset that the annual fare increases do not seem to have translated into better service quality. Given the number and increasing frequency of the breakdowns, it is time to form a national, public, no holds barred, independent inquiry into the maintenance and operations, even construction, of the entire MRT system. He said that lessons learnt from a detailed investigation would be useful for future lines that Singapore is so heavily investing in and beneficial to any future entities that are selected to take over the current operations.

Referring to the report, ""Steps taken to fix series of train disruptions: SMRT"", forum writer “Patrick Tan Siong Kuan” said the SMRT's new management team has been in place for some time now and, yet, breakdowns and security lapses continue. As long as the MRT system is run by a profit-making organisation with a monopoly, the vested interests of shareholders and management will take precedence over those of commuters. The trust and confidence of commuters in SMRT have been eroded. If this continues, it may affect the confidence in the Land Transport Authority's sincerity and capability to fix the problem, added Mr Patrick Tan. He opines that it is time to acknowledge that the model has broken down.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"Mediacorp carried delayed coverage of the media statements made by LTA and SMRT on Mar 3. 

The authorities are investigating the recent spate of train service disruptions on SMRT’s rail network and plan to review the operator’s resources and processes for maintaining the rail system. Calling the situation “unacceptable”, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it has asked SMRT to investigate the disruptions — with two incidents on Tuesday (March 3) bringing the count to five in nine days — and provide a full account. “The LTA will be working with SMRT on the immediate remedial actions to turn around the situation,” a spokesperson said on Tuesday. “We intend to review again SMRT’s management of resources and processes for the maintenance of the rail system.”

In an interview with Channel News Asia, Professor Lee Der Hong said SMRT faces several challenges:-
• Demands on public transport system means operators have less than four hours to carry out maintenance work
• Complexity of work, manpower constraints and land scarcity
• The design of our MRT system did not cater for backup tracks to allow closure on certain tracks to carry out servicing, without causing disruption to existing revenue service.
• He suggested that it may be necessary to close the system for longer periods of time to carry out essential maintenance.
• He suggested SMRT adopt CCTV imaging detection and analysis techniques to detect break-in.

She had actually broken her bone and had to undergo an emergency surgery to have a metal plate inserted. She told The New paper that she was about to alight when the bus driver jammed the brakes. 

Responding to queries from TNP, SMRT is said to be investigating the matter. VP of CIC, Mr Patrick Nathan said: “We got in touch with Madam Nurlaili and her family and will be providing further information to her and her family as it becomes available to us”, he added that we are sorry that she had this unfortunate experience.

SMRT Buses,CSR,Positive ,"Three 19-year-old Ngee Ann Polytechnic students, Matthew Lee, Kok Jian Yu and Jeremy Lim, have developed a voice-assisted app called TrAVEl (Travel Assistant for the Visually Impaired and the Elderly), to help people get from place to place more easily. It guides the user throughout his journey, including any change of buses, by using GPS to track where he is.  He can either type or speak into the mobile device to enter his destination. The app lets him know when his bus arrives, and gives a running commentary of the bus stops en route, as well as alerting the traveller if he needs to change buses.

It took 16 weeks for the students to complete and was developed in collaboration with SMRT, which provided them with the database of buses and technology to calculate the arrival times. The app is among the 50 final-year projects to be displayed at Infinite 2015, the School of InfoComm Technology’s graduation showcase, held from March 5-7.

They were later arrested at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Nov 20, and extradited to Singapore on Nov 21. They each pleaded guilty to two charges of illegal trespass, as well as vandalising the train.

SMRT was quoted saying both men “went to great lengths and made an extraordinary effort” to exploit security vulnerabilities.”

As she was preparing to get off the bus, she stood up and held onto a railing. The bus suddenly braked twice, and she fell, fracturing her arm. She ended up receiving 15 stitches. She lodged a police report at a police station the next day after she was discharged. A police spokesman said investigations are ongoing, and the woman is appealing for information on the incident"
SMRT Corporate,Facilities ,Positive ,"The Kallang Wave Mall is jointly managed and operated by SMRT Corp and NTUC. It held its opening ceremony last Thurs. The mall is located right at the train station exit. It has attracted 8 million visitors since it opened and most Singaporeans and tourists took train to get to the mall. As part of the mall’s opening promotions, it is running a promotion in conjunction with the Disney movie, “Cinderella”."
,,,"Straits Times reader, “Mark Lim Xian Jin”, writes to the forum, “I was one of the passengers affected by the MRT train disruption on Tuesday evening (""Steps taken to fix series of train disruptions: SMRT""; Wednesday). 

At Boon Lay MRT station, there was a lack of adequate information about alternative forms of transport, such as shuttle bus services. We were told at 5.50pm to head to the designated bus stop for shuttle bus service. But there was no SMRT staff to guide us or inform us about the status of train or shuttle bus services. 

The designated bus stop was also a drop-off point for private buses ferrying staff, so that added to the confusion. 

No shuttle bus arrived in the 20 minutes that train services were down. When train services resumed at 6.10pm, the station was packed, but only one fare-gate gantry was open. 

Also, shuttle services, if provided, should not be terminated immediately after train services have partially resumed. Considering the fact that the trains and buses would be overloaded, the shuttle services could have helped ease the situation. 

I understand that train breakdowns are an unforeseen event. Still, shouldn't the relevant information be properly communicated to the public to minimise confusion? 

Given the frequency of train disruptions in recent weeks and complaints of the lack of proper communication in such events, it is high time SMRT and the Land Transport Authority reviewed their processes when it comes to these situations. 

They should also review the state of our train systems and try to identify the reasons behind these breakdowns. The trains on the East-West and North-South lines may be old, but trains on newer lines, too, are experiencing frequent breakdowns.”

SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Neutral ,"LTA has called for a tender to replace rail fasteners along the Botanic Gardens (Circle Line) stretch to be carried out after operational hours and be completed by second quarter next year after receiving public feedback. 

A spokesperson said: “LTA is replacing the rail fasteners, which hold and support the rails on which the trains run, near the Circle Line’s Botanic Gardens station. This is to reduce the higher track vibrations levels felt there.” LTA found the vibration levels between Serangoon and Holland Village station to be “within specified limits”.

Tender documents show LTA is looking to replace the line’s “double fast-clip rail fastening system”. ST reporter Christopher Tan highlighted that this is the second time rectification works have had to be done on the six-year-old line, the first being a $15 million project to replace 120 km of power cables last year.

,,,"Forum writer “Wu Guo Yan” is also a SMRT relief taxi driver. He shared that he had a minor accident with another taxi at Changi Airport Terminal 3 and both him and the other taxi agreed not to report the accident as it was a minor one and they were both at fault. 

He stopped driving the taxi for a period of time when the hirer decided to terminate his contract. When he later resumed driving again, he was asked to pay $2500 as he did not report the accident within a certain time frame. He questioned why was there a need to pay the sum even when SMRT found the vehicle he drove that time to suffered no damage. He commented that some of the departments in the company were unable to give him a satisfactory answer.

SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Positive ,"SMRT intends plans to recruit more engineers and technicians, as well as bringing forward some planned initiatives, such as the new maintenance operations centre, under a multi-year effort to improve the rail network.

Most media reported that by 2018, the number of SMRT engineers and technicians is expected to grow by 39 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively. This is to meet with an “expanded network and higher operating standards”, said Managing Director of SMRT Trains, Mr Lee Ling Wee.

Most dailies, including ST, LHZB, Shin Min and Wanbao highlighted that a new maintenance operations centre will be set up – a central facility with experts to guide crew on ground when breakdown occurs. In the coming year, there are plans to equip station staff with simple maintenance skills, so they can deal with minor delays and disruptions.

Addressing perceptions that SMRT was not acting quickly enough, President and Group CEO Desmond Kuek said the multi-year initatives are complex and not programmes one can “buy off the shelf”. He added: “Even as we are making improvements to the system, the system continues to age. At the same time, we are also dealing with the bringing in of new systems, new capabilities that interphase and interoperate very closely with the existing legacy system.” Acknowledging that recent service disruptions – five in nine days – have shaken commuters’ confidence, he said the disruptions underscore the need for the transport operator to keep up its vigilance and maintenance efforts.

The New Paper did a simple table to highlight six key initatives SMRT will be embarking to bring about a higher level of reliability. They are cross-training, the new maintenance operations centre, mobile operations maintenance systems, advanced sensors fitted under passenger trains, LVDT, sleeper and signal system replacement.

Most dailies, including ST, LHZB, Shin Min and Wanbao highlighted that a new maintenance operations centre will be set up – a central facility with experts to guide crew on ground when breakdown occurs. In the coming year, there are plans to equip station staff with simple maintenance skills, so they can deal with minor delays and disruptions.

Addressing perceptions that SMRT was not acting quickly enough, President and Group CEO Desmond Kuek said the multi-year initatives are complex and not programmes one can “buy off the shelf”. He added: “Even as we are making improvements to the system, the system continues to age. At the same time, we are also dealing with the bringing in of new systems, new capabilities that interphase and interoperate very closely with the existing legacy system.” Acknowledging that recent service disruptions – five in nine days – have shaken commuters’ confidence, he said the disruptions underscore the need for the transport operator to keep up its vigilance and maintenance efforts.

The New Paper did a simple table to highlight six key initatives SMRT will be embarking to bring about a higher level of reliability. They are cross-training, the new maintenance operations centre, mobile operations maintenance systems, advanced sensors fitted under passenger trains, LVDT, sleeper and signal system replacement.

SMRT Trains,Safety/Accident,Neutral ,This was the delayed Shin Min report on the trial and sentencing of the two German vandals who entered Bishan Depot last year.
SMRT Trains,Safety/Accident,Neutral ,"Attorney General Chambers responded to criticism over the caning of two German men who vandalised a train after sneaking into Bishan depot. The spokesman said that these foreigners came to Singapore and deliberately flouted our rules by repeatedly trespassing into security sensitive areas.

SMRT had to spend $6,500 on cleaning the train and another $71,50 to supervise the operation. The affected train was taken off service for nine days, affecting more than 200,000 commuter trips.

A spokesman for the German embassy here said its government “is opposed to corporal punishment anywhere in the world, including in Singapore”. Responding to the embassy spokesman, AGC said “caning is not torture and is carried out in Singapore under strict standards, monitored at all times by a doctor”. 

It was reported that most netizens who posted comments on news sites, such as those in Britain and Australia, praised Singapore for its strong stance against vandalism, with several urging their own governments to do the same.

SMRT Trains,Safety/Accident,Negative,"Services along the Bukit Panjang LRT (BPLRT) will be suspended until Tuesday morning (Mar 10) SMRT announced on Monday evening. In a statement to the media, SMRT said a power trip between Pending and Jelapang stations at about 5.30pm caused train services to be disrupted on the entire line. Separately, a fire broke out at Senja station's plant room at about 5.45pm, where power-tie breakers were found to be damaged. 

A Facebook update by SMRT at 7pm yesterday (Mar 9) said: ""Services on the BPLRT will not resume this evening. We are working to recover service by tomorrow morning and are investigating the cause of the incident. Free bus and bus bridging services will continue. We ask commuters to seek alternative transport options.""

Several commuters were interviewed, most cited their experience of frequent breakdowns of the BPLRT. 

Mr Liang Eng Hwa, MP for Zhenghua constituency, urged both SMRT and the Government to find the root cause of the fire and said that it was “quite a big disappointment that this has happened so many times”, and “LTA and SMRT need to get their act together to really bring up the reliability of the system and win back the public’s confidence.”

Mr Lim Biow Chuan, who sits on the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, said SMRT should provide compensation to commuters as “it might cost them (SMRT) a lot, but I think they should show some contrition.”

MD of SMRT Trains, Mr Lee Ling Wee said: “Trains services could not be resumed as power tie-breakers were damaged in the fire.” He added “SMRT is investigating the root cause of the incident” and “we are very sorry for the inconvenience caused to commuters.”

Separately, a fire broke out at Senja station's plant room at about 5.45pm, where power-tie breakers were found to be damaged. 

A Facebook update by SMRT at 7pm yesterday (Mar 9) said: ""Services on the BPLRT will not resume this evening. We are working to recover service by tomorrow morning and are investigating the cause of the incident. Free bus and bus bridging services will continue. We ask commuters to seek alternative transport options.""

Several commuters were interviewed, most cited their experience of frequent breakdowns of the BPLRT. 

Mr Liang Eng Hwa, MP for Zhenghua constituency, urged both SMRT and the Government to find the root cause of the fire and said that it was “quite a big disappointment that this has happened so many times”, and “LTA and SMRT need to get their act together to really bring up the reliability of the system and win back the public’s confidence.”

Mr Lim Biow Chuan, who sits on the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, said SMRT should provide compensation to commuters as “it might cost them (SMRT) a lot, but I think they should show some contrition.”

MD of SMRT Trains, Mr Lee Ling Wee said: “Trains services could not be resumed as power tie-breakers were damaged in the fire.” He added “SMRT is investigating the root cause of the incident” and “we are very sorry for the inconvenience caused to commuters.”

Most media carried the updates made on SMRT Facebook and Twitter page, as well as the interviews made with various commuters and MPs that visited Senja station.

A fire at Senja LRT station due to electrical short-circuit had crippled the Bukit Panjang LRT service. While a traction power trip between Pending and Petir LRT station caused passengers on to be detrained. At 5.30pm, the Bukit Panjang LRT service was disrupted due to a traction power trip between Pending and Petir stations. At 5.45pm, a fire alarm was sounded at Senja Station as a fire involved a circuit breaker was started inside the electrical room.

Some reports carried the quotes by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Mr Lim Biow Chuan. Dr Vivian thanked the staff working through the night and commented that 40 SMRT buses will be deployed to ensure free bus services till BPLRT resumes service. Mr Lim Biow Chuan, who sits on the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, said SMRT should provide compensation to commuters. ""It might cost them a lot, but I think they should show some contrition.""


Mar 10 (day of recovery)
Most media carried the on-ground situation at Senja station, interviews with MPs and the recovery of the services after 4pm. Reports were neutral to positive, highlighting the deployment of 100 SMRT staff, 45 buses to ensure commuters reach their destinations.

The Bukit Panjang Light Rail Transit (BPLRT) was down for nearly 24 hours, with services resuming fully at 4.30 pm on Tuesday after an electrical fire broke out on Monday. Train service resumed partially at 12.30 pm on Tuesday but only for the outer loop Service A from Senja to Petir, with Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SMRT engineers and technicians working through the night. Trains on Service A of the line restarted on Tuesday afternoon (Mar 10), SMRT said in a tweet at 12.43pm. Service B - which runs in the opposite direction - resumed at 4.30pm, said SMRT in a statement later on Tuesday

Most media carried the quote by MD Trains, Mr Lee Ling Wee: ""We understand that many commuters have been affected by the BPLRT disruption. We deeply apologise for the inconvenience caused and are grateful to commuters for their patience and understanding.” Commuters will be able to ride on the BPLRT for free till 12 noon, 11 Mar.

ST reporter Adrian Lim, highlighted several key incidents that had happened to the Bukit Panjang LRT Line since 2000. The BPLRT had 50 disruptions in its first three years of operations. Over the years, the line's lack of reliability has been a source of frustration for commuters. In the first nine months of last year, there were 59 incidents of delays.

A LHZB editor opined that the recent series of train disruptions showed that the authorities have to review if the train service supervision and maintenance reforms following the major train disruptions in 2011 are adequate. Besides supervising train service providers, the Land Transport Authority should also consider stepping up funding and manpower to speed up the upgrading and maintenance of trains.

The Bukit Panjang Light Rail Transit (BPLRT) was down for nearly 24 hours, with services resuming fully at 4.30 pm on Tuesday after an electrical fire broke out on Monday. Train service resumed partially at 12.30 pm on Tuesday but only for the outer loop Service A from Senja to Petir, with Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SMRT engineers and technicians working through the night. Trains on Service A of the line restarted on Tuesday afternoon (Mar 10), SMRT said in a tweet at 12.43pm. Service B - which runs in the opposite direction - resumed at 4.30pm, said SMRT in a statement later on Tuesday

Most media carried the quote by MD Trains, Mr Lee Ling Wee: ""We understand that many commuters have been affected by the BPLRT disruption. We deeply apologise for the inconvenience caused and are grateful to commuters for their patience and understanding.” Commuters will be able to ride on the BPLRT for free till 12 noon, 11 Mar.

ST reporter Adrian Lim, highlighted several key incidents that had happened to the Bukit Panjang LRT Line since 2000. The BPLRT had 50 disruptions in its first three years of operations. Over the years, the line's lack of reliability has been a source of frustration for commuters. In the first nine months of last year, there were 59 incidents of delays.

A LHZB editor opined that the recent series of train disruptions showed that the authorities have to review if the train service supervision and maintenance reforms following the major train disruptions in 2011 are adequate. Besides supervising train service providers, the Land Transport Authority should also consider stepping up funding and manpower to speed up the upgrading and maintenance of trains.

Mar 10, 8am to 7pm – The Minister progressively updated on Facebook the restoration of services on BPLRT. He said that LTA and SMRT must continue to put maximum effort and resources to restore full service and conduct a thorought investigation and provide its assessments and recommendations.

Most of the news sources covered his comments factually.

Taxi,Safety/Accident,Negative,SMRT taxi partner (SHB 714 T) was said to had driven against traffic flow into a petrol station and obstructed other vehicles for 10 minutes. Other drivers had to reverse out of the petrol station. The taxi driver has been slammed for being too selfish by online citizens.
SMRT Trains,Safety/Accident,Negative,"These were the delayed news reports on the resumption of BPLRT services.

The Bukit Panjang LRT services were disrupted for nearly 24 hours. Media reports claimed that the outage affected an estimated 40,000 commuters. It completely resumed its services before the evening rush hour yesterday. SMRT said they are conducting a full investigation and will announce the details when results are out. 

Several commuters were interviewed, while some commented that were disappointed with the disruptions, some of them were glad that they got to travel for free yesterday, Mar 11. A few noticed longer travelling times. Wanbao visited Senja Station yesterday morning and evening and noticed smooth operations and minimal crowd at station platforms. Wanbao interviewed Dr Lee Der Horng, who referred to the series of rail disruptions as a bout of “train disease” and commented that although the incidents are not related, but reflected a “mismanagement within SMRT.” 

He then suggested that LTA and SMRT work together conduct a thorough investigation of the reasons behind the incidents. Commenting on the BPLRT incident, he mentioned that the impact was significant as it affected the entire BPLRT network with more than 10,000 daily passengers. In addition, due to the poor road connectivity of Bukit Panjang, the impact of providing free shuttle buses is limited. 

Shin Min reported that Minister of Environment and Water Resources, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, thanked the SMRT drivers and service ambassadors who operated the free bus services for us (nearby residents) yesterday on his Facebook page. 


ST Reporter Christopher Tan wrote an opinion piece in light of the BPLRT incident.
He said that the 24-hour shutdown of full services on the Bukit Panjang LRT throws up troubling questions about the integrity of the country's rail system, such as why was there a fire despite the circuit breaker tripping and if SMRT find out what caused the arcing in the first place? While it may be overdramatic to compare the Challenger (NASA space shuttle) blast to the spate of rail failures, it goes to show that the robustness of an entire system is only as good as its weakest link. He argued that in Singapore's case, a fire in the country's highly utilised and largely underground rail network could spell disaster. The fact that there had been at least two other rail fires (2004, 2013 – Newton Station) underscores the gravity of the matter.

SMRT Trains,Safety/Accident,Negative,A comic making light of the recent Bukit Panjang LRT breakdown was published in the Straits Times.
SMRT Trains,Safety/Accident,Negative,"Committee of Supply Debates – Rail Disruptions

Addressing Parliament on his Ministry’s plans right on the heels of a spate of MRT disruptions, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew yesterday expressed his unhappiness about the situation and described the incidents — including a 23-hour Bukit Panjang LRT system breakdown that occurred over Monday and Tuesday — as “stark reminders” that there is still some way to go in improving train reliability.

Speaking on the earlier rail disruptions, he highlighted that four generations of trains run on the main network - three from Kawasaki and one from Siemens. Mr Lui said the ""reliability of the Siemens train was certainly very different from Kawasaki trains"". The problems were with the doors and electrical cards. ""So when you do a systematic health check like this, you are able to determine and identify trends, you are able to spotlight the mean times between failures for components and if necessary, you do a complete change out, which is what we did for the doors,"" he said. Since then, Mr Lui said the spate of door problems with this particular generation of trains has been mitigated
While an occasional breakdown or even a severe disruption on a very rare occasion is tolerable, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said yesterday that he was ""most upset"" with the rail situation in the last few weeks. The recent disruptions have come as a setback after a year when rail reliability seemed to be improving. Yesterday, Members of Parliament asked about what was being done to fix a rail system bugged by both disruption and security problems. There have been eight disruptions since Feb 16, and although some of the train disruptions are not due to the transport operator's fault, the incidents have affected confidence in the transport system. Mr Lui promised improvements, and his raising of statistics which showed a decline in train withdrawals and delays showed that we should not look at the recency effect of things. Before this series of incidents happened, commuters have felt an improvement in train services, according to a study by SIM University.

Addressing Parliament on his Ministry’s plans right on the heels of a spate of MRT disruptions, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew yesterday expressed his unhappiness about the situation and described the incidents — including a 23-hour Bukit Panjang LRT system breakdown that occurred over Monday and Tuesday — as “stark reminders” that there is still some way to go in improving train reliability.

Speaking on the earlier rail disruptions, he highlighted that four generations of trains run on the main network - three from Kawasaki and one from Siemens. Mr Lui said the ""reliability of the Siemens train was certainly very different from Kawasaki trains"". The problems were with the doors and electrical cards. ""So when you do a systematic health check like this, you are able to determine and identify trends, you are able to spotlight the mean times between failures for components and if necessary, you do a complete change out, which is what we did for the doors,"" he said. Since then, Mr Lui said the spate of door problems with this particular generation of trains has been mitigated
While an occasional breakdown or even a severe disruption on a very rare occasion is tolerable, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said yesterday that he was ""most upset"" with the rail situation in the last few weeks. The recent disruptions have come as a setback after a year when rail reliability seemed to be improving. Yesterday, Members of Parliament asked about what was being done to fix a rail system bugged by both disruption and security problems. There have been eight disruptions since Feb 16, and although some of the train disruptions are not due to the transport operator's fault, the incidents have affected confidence in the transport system. Mr Lui promised improvements, and his raising of statistics which showed a decline in train withdrawals and delays showed that we should not look at the recency effect of things. Before this series of incidents happened, commuters have felt an improvement in train services, according to a study by SIM University.

Depending on the response, SMRT said it will look into having such priority queues at its four other bus interchanges, if space permits.

The first bus interchange to have priority queues for senior citizens and special needs commuters rolled out its services on Saturday (Mar 14). The Priority Queue Initiative was launched as part of a pilot trial at Yishun temporary bus interchange. Seniors and special needs commuters such as expectant mothers and the disabled will be able to sit in a designated area while they wait for their buses. MP for Nee Soon GRC Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, who was at the launch of the pilot service, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is exploring the feasibility of making the service available at other interchanges and hoped residents will show kindness and graciousness to their seniors. ""LTA will look into extending this initiative to new and existing interchanges where space permits,"" he said in a Facebook post. Photos of a SMRT bus captain assisting a wheelchair user board a bus, as well as the priority queues was shared on by several media agencies.

The new facility, which opened on Saturday (March 14) is positioned opposite Northpoint Shopping Centre, and commuters must now cross an extra road to get from the MRT station to the interchange. According to a Facebook post on March 14, SMRT said it invested many hours engaging Yishun residents, schools in the area, the Ministry of Transport and the Land Transport Authority before the move. It had also conducted trials with wheelchair users and engaged commuters to serve as service ambassadors for the first few days of operations.Other comments about the interchange are that the new temporary interchange is bigger than the previous one, resulting in a longer walk for some. Minor complaints also include the misuse of the priority queue, the occasional jam and confusion over the amended routes of a few buses.

Note: The story was reposted on Hardwarezone Forum with 41 comments from netizens as of 12:40pm. Almost everyone criticised the story and spoke up for the Yishun TBI and defended SMRT Buses. They have said:

VP CIC, Mr Patrick Nathan said that the SMRT Connect app that provides bus information does not display the line ""estimation unavailable"", as cited in Mr Sim's letter. SMRT's bus services strive continually for improvements in time keeping and customer service. We have also worked hard to improve the Connect app's bus arrival timings so they average 90 per cent accuracy. On occasion, however, traffic conditions may lead to a longer bus arrival timing experienced by commuters, despite buses leaving interchanges at prescribed intervals. The SMRT Connect app will update commuters accordingly during such situations. We will continue to monitor and improve the accuracy of our Connect app. He advised Mr Sim for details of the specific bus service referred to in his letter as well as the transport app used."
SMRT Buses,Facilities ,Neutral ,"Eight bidders have been shortlisted for an inaugural government bus contract, according to information on the Land Transport Authority (LTA) website. The companies are bidding for the right to operate 26 services out of the new Bulim depot in Jurong West from the second half of next year. ST reporter Christopher Tan wrote that observers said the incumbents have a natural advantage because they would not incur “transition costs”, but foreign players may be favoured because the authorities want a fresh injection of competition and ideas.


Here are the list of shortlisted companies and their bids
• SMRT Buses - $93.7 million
• Go-Ahead (Britain) - $153.5 million
• SBS Transit - $125.2 million
• Tower Transit (Australia) - $125.6 million
• Busways (Australia) - $127.8 million
• Keolis (France) - $131.6 million
• RATP (France) – implied annual value of $143 million
• Woodlands Transport - $145.9 million


SMRT’s bid is 25 per cent lower than the next lowest bid, or a difference of nearly $160 million for the five-year contract. When asked if SMRT can be profitable with such a low bid, chief executive Desmond Kuek said: “We sure hope so. We have studied it very carefully.”

The winning bid is expected to be announced as early as next month

Ms Huang also thanked the maintenance crew that work in the wee hours of the night to ensure minimal noise and disruption to commuters and residents. While government has ordered the operator to enhance its maintenance mechanism to improve the train network, she commented that SMRT did not hope for incidents like this to happen.

He cited figures that showed improving reliability but highlighted that breakdowns more than 30 munutes have rose last year to 12. He concluded that the host of problems SMRT is facing “are less to do with build quality than maintenance”.NEL, CCL, DTL – He highlighted the major replacements works on NEL and CCL, such as the U-bolts on NEL and the power cables on CCL. He commented that “newer systems have quality issues right from the start”. But he cautioned that it is important to know what these problems are and simply assigning blame to poor maintenance will not do anyone any good. BPLRT – He said that getting this problematic line in shape may be akin to getting a Lada to perform like a Toyota, and questioned if resources would be better spent on providing more feeder buses. “Clearly, this was a poorly built system, compounded by less-than optimal maintenance over the years”. In summary, he concluded that commuters will have no choice but to “grit their teeth as the network undergoes various stages of repair and rejuvenation” and we are at the steepest stage of our learning curve because our first lines are coming of age and require overhauls. But once we go past this steep curve, we should be far better to deal with problems.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"These were the evening news coverage of the BPLRT disruption on Monday. Mar 30.

There was a train disruption along Bukit Panjang LRT again on Mon at around 6.45pm, the second time in three weeks, and passengers had to walk along the tracks again. Wanbao reported that this was the 10th train disruption in the last few months.

Some passengers onboard the defective train commented that the train moved intermittently before coming to a halt. In-train announcements were barely audible and waited for 50 minutes before service staff detrained them to Bukit Panjang station.

Taxi,Fares,Neutral ,"In response to the new rules set to be implemented to regulate how cab companies structure their fares, industry players say that the move is a good first step and will merely prevent fares from becoming more complex but will not have much impact on the current situation. Executive adviser of the National Taxi Association (NTA) noted that the next step should be taken to see how the taxi business model can be redesigned. While he noted that the flag-down rates are still different, he acknowledge the difficulties of standardising this fee because of the different car models being bought by the companies at different times. Mr Ang also raised concerns about the new fare structure being anti-competitive and said that NTA will be monitoring this closely.

Most of the dailies reported that the current business model in which the flag-down rates are closely tied to the taxi rentals and costs may have to be revoked for this to change, which could lead to a simplification of fares. On the other hand, interviewed cabbies and commuters are generally happy with the change. 

Cab companies ComfortDelGro and SMRT however, welcomed the changes and said that they would do the necessary steps to implement the new regulations. SMRT which has two sets of metered rates for its premium cabs will have to standardise this down to one rate to comply with the new rules.

Taxi,Fares,Neutral ,"In an effort to streamline fares and ease confusion for commuters, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Public Transport Council (PTC) recommended that, form the second half of the year, taxi operators will have to abide by the new fare rules with varying degrees of standardisation being imposed on operators for surcharges, meter fares and booking fees but not the flag-down fares. Once the changes are approved, all the cabs on the road will have to charge the same peak-period, location, city and midnight surcharge rates. 

With regards to the location-based surcharge, operators are given a choice to opt out of imposing this surcharge if they wish to. Currently, only SMRT and Prime have a $3 surcharge for Marina Bay Sands at some times of the day but other cab companies have chosen not to impose this. Standardisation for call booking rates and metered rates will be less stringent. Operators can choose how much they want to charge for these but they must maintain one set of rates for all their regular taxis and another for their premium taxis. Commuters generally welcome the change. 

Straits Times Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan wrote an opinion piece on the restricting. He noted that while the cab fare review will likely lead to a more structure system that prevents further clutter, it is unlikely to lead to a huge improvement as the biggest confusion now lies with the range of flag-down rates. LTA chose not to harmonise the differing flag-down rates which are largely determined by taxi rental rates, for fear that operators might level them up. However, Christopher Tan noted that the different rental rates are merely a way for cab companies to maximise profits and he thinks that fares can standardised without causing confusion to commuters, such as allowing the cab companies to compete on the quality of vehicles and driver benefits. He added that, if the complex menu of surcharges were to be flattened, simplified or reduced, the average fare would not be higher and he went on to give an example of the fare structure in Hong Kong which has only one flag down rate and uniform fare stages. He noted that this made taxi drivers in Hong Kong more motivated compared to cabbies in Singapore. While he acknowledged that when Singapore introduced the taxi availability standards too years ago, it got cabbies to work harder, but he commented that it takes manpower and effort to enforce such standards and it would have been better to go a step further to achieve a higher goal.

Straits Times Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan wrote an opinion piece on the restricting. He noted that while the cab fare review will likely lead to a more structure system that prevents further clutter, it is unlikely to lead to a huge improvement as the biggest confusion now lies with the range of flag-down rates. LTA chose not to harmonise the differing flag-down rates which are largely determined by taxi rental rates, for fear that operators might level them up. However, Christopher Tan noted that the different rental rates are merely a way for cab companies to maximise profits and he thinks that fares can standardised without causing confusion to commuters, such as allowing the cab companies to compete on the quality of vehicles and driver benefits. He added that, if the complex menu of surcharges were to be flattened, simplified or reduced, the average fare would not be higher and he went on to give an example of the fare structure in Hong Kong which has only one flag down rate and uniform fare stages. He noted that this made taxi drivers in Hong Kong more motivated compared to cabbies in Singapore. While he acknowledged that when Singapore introduced the taxi availability standards too years ago, it got cabbies to work harder, but he commented that it takes manpower and effort to enforce such standards and it would have been better to go a step further to achieve a higher goal.

While acknowledging that taxi fare standardisation is a good step in the right direction, both Shin Min and Wanbao highlighted that commuters are still confused by the taxi fare structures. Industry players and experts stated that the new standard acts as a barrier to prevent any additional complication of fare structure by operators. Hence, it provides time for the authorities to review and further simplify the taxi fare structure. Other experts felt that the authorities intervened at an appropriate timing, in efforts to prevent a monopoly of taxi services.

Taxi,Fares,Neutral ,"Under new regulations proposed by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the PTC, the structure of certain taxi fare components and surcharges are to be standardised across all taxi companies. Mr Ang Hin Kee, executive advisor of the National Taxi Association (NTA) noted that allowing firms to set surcharges together may be anti-competitive. He added that allowing operators to discuss uniform charges may adversely affect commuters and drivers, without adequate checks and balances on the part of PTC. In response to concerns that taxi firms might violate the Competition Act, PTC noted that taxi companies will not fall afoul of the Competition Act in agreeing on the structure of certain taxi fare components, if they are doing so to comply with a legislative requirement.

Currently, only SMRT and Prime have a $3 surcharge for Marina Bay Sands at some times of the day but other cab companies have chosen not to impose this. Speaking to the media on the proposed changes, commuters generally welcome the change. Commuter Rena Tan noted that although flag down fares will not be standardised, at least some of the surcharges are now the same.

Speaking to the media on the proposed changes, commuters generally welcome the change. Commuter Rena Tan noted that although flag down fares will not be standardised, at least some of the surcharges are now the same. However, she added that there is usually a shortage of cabs hence leaving commuters with no choice but to take the cab even though they know it will cost more.

Forum,,,"Referring to the letter, “Proper materials management key to tackling rail hitches” (March 21), forum writer “Leoson Hoay Hong Cheng” said certain aspects of materials management are not well regarded by top management at Singapore companies. 

The writer added that the deeper issue with materials management is how the materials are conceived within the company philosophies. In many cases, materials management activities are side-lined relative to other operations. 

To avoid serious consequences due to material oversight, the writer said that it is essential to re-evaluate how materials management is positioned within the constellation of company production functions. This applies to core service providers such as SMRT, as well as telecoms and freight organisations.

SMRT Corporate,Customer Service ,Positive ,"The deluge of social media agencies is a result of increasing advertiser demand upon realising the influence that social media chatter has on everyday behaviour. Even mom-and-pop shops have set up Facebook pages to market their services. Some companies, like telco StarHub and rail operator SMRT, also use social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to broadcast messages to customers and manage customer feedback. The most sophisticated, albeit controversial, form is paying bloggers or ""influencers"" to shape market perception - which Singtel and Gushcloud bungled by taking ethical short cuts."
SMRT Buses,Safety/Accident,Negative,"A 88 year-old granny, Madam Ting Lan Kin, suffered a serious injury to her left leg while alighting from the bus at a bus stop near Woodlands Town Park. 

A Shin Min reporter visited the granny at the hospital noting that her left ankle is wrapped up in bandages. Her left foot had to be amputated due to infection concerns. The granny's son in law noted that employees from SMRT have called to apologise and to explain that the incident happened because the driver had forgotten to engage the handbrake. The family plans to engage a lawyer to seek compensation not just for the granny's medical fees but also for her future expenses. 

Head of CMC, Ms Margaret Teo, said members of the public and the bus driver administered first aid for the victim and sent the granny to the incident. She said: “We have met the lady’s son to apologise for the incident and will extend assistance to the family as best as we can.”

As of Sunday, Apr 5, Mdm Ting Lan Kin was visibly active when reporters visited her in the hospital.

The time for the elderly to alight can be automatically extended when an senior citizen ez-link card is scanned.

SMRT Buses,Regulations,Positive ,"Under the trial Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF), 22 bus services from the two public transport operators, SBS Transit and SMRT were selected to be reviewed and 18 bus services were found to have improved in terms of service reliability and both operators were rewarded for the improvements. SBS Transit was awarded $710,285.71 for improving 11 services, while SMRT received $345,714.29 for improvements made to seven. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said the trial – which rewards operators for improvements and penalises them if reliability worsens – has shown “encouraging results” with improvements, with 18 of 22 services that are part of the exercise improving enough to earn incentives. 
When asked how the reward would be used, SMRT spokesperson noted that in addition to using it to defray the increased costs for employing additional manpower to monitor the services, the company will be using the money to enhance the communication technologies for the buses. SMRT will also continue to improve the services for the three bus service that was not rewarded.
Several dailies carried comments by National University of Singapore transport expert Lee Der Horng who said SBST and SMRT have to find ways to translate the improved reliability into customer experience. Customers do not measure waiting times at the level of seconds, he said, referring to the 0.1 minute unit used to determine how much incentives and penalties are incurred under the framework. “Passengers may not really feel the difference of one minute above or below the excess wait time,” said Prof Lee. “They are concerned whether the bus will come regularly, and frequently during the peak hours.” To improve commuters’ experience, a service with low excess wait time (EWT) but also low frequency could be improved by having buses arrive in shorter intervals, he said.

Customers do not measure waiting times at the level of seconds, he said, referring to the 0.1 minute unit used to determine how much incentives and penalties are incurred under the framework. “Passengers may not really feel the difference of one minute above or below the excess wait time,” said Prof Lee. “They are concerned whether the bus will come regularly, and frequently during the peak hours.” To improve commuters’ experience, a service with low excess wait time (EWT) but also low frequency could be improved by having buses arrive in shorter intervals, he said.

SMRT Buses,Regulations,Positive ,"Under the trial Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF), 22 bus services from the two public transport operators, SBS Transit and SMRT were selected to be reviewed and 18 bus services were found to have improved in terms of service reliability and both operators were rewarded for the improvements. SBS Transit was awarded $710,285.71 for improving 11 services, while SMRT received $345,714.29 for improvements made to seven. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said the trial – which rewards operators for improvements and penalises them if reliability worsens – has shown “encouraging results” with improvements, with 18 of 22 services that are part of the exercise improving enough to earn incentives. 
When asked how the reward would be used, SMRT spokesperson noted that in addition to using it to defray the increased costs for employing additional manpower to monitor the services, the company will be using the money to enhance the communication technologies for the buses. SMRT will also continue to improve the services for the three bus service that was not rewarded.

The new bus services and route changes were announced in February, but LTA said it took more time to address the additional concerns of residents before finalising the routes.

With the introduction of the two services, existing feeder service 300 will skip Choa Chu Kang Avenue 5 while service 982E will stop at two more bus stops. The new bus services and route changes were announced in February, but LTA said it took more time to address the additional concerns of residents before finalising the routes. This was “to ensure that these bus services would satisfy the needs of commuters” by maintaining a direct connection from Choa Chu Kang Avenue 5 and Avenue 2 to Choa Chu Kang Primary School. LTA said it would “continue to engage the community in planning bus services”, to ensure the services  benefit “as many commuters as possible.”

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said he has instructed the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SMRT to ""get to the bottom of the recent disruptions"". He said this in a written Parliamentary response on Monday (Apr 13) to Member of Parliament Lee Bee Wah, who had asked about the recent spate of breakdowns within a span of a few days. Mr Lui said that the recent spate of disruptions is ""regrettable"" given the inconvenience it caused commuters, and also because train reliability has seen ""significant improvements in recent times"".

Mr Lui said that SMRT has announced that it will thoroughly review and strengthen its maintenance regime, including setting up a Maintenance Operations Centre, increasing engineering resources and training staff to handle minor maintenance issues so that problems can be resolved promptly. Meanwhile, LTA will step up audits of SMRT’s rail maintenance resources and processes as well as support with engineering expertise as part of a joint team’s continuing efforts to improve train reliability, he added. Singapore’s current train delay rate is better than New York City’s but worse than Hong Kong’s, he added, with the number of delays lasting more than five minutes on the North-South and East-West lines having improved by over 25 per cent in the last three years.

SMRT Buses,Safety/Accident,Negative,"Four people were injured when an accident took place at Ang Mo Kio Ave 5 involving an SMRT bus, a Comfort taxi, two other cars and a Maserati. According to the article, an eyewitness said that the SMRT Bus, Comfort taxi and two other cars were stationary at the traffic light when the Maserati lost control and crashed into the car behind. The impact was so strong that it caused a chain effect, with the car crashing into another car which crashed into the taxi and the taxi in turn, crashed into the bus. Four men and a women sustained slight injuries and were sent to the hospital. No one on the SMRT bus suffered any injuries.

The driver of the bus was interviewed after the accident by Lianhe WanBao. The article noted that the female bus driver was still recovering from the shock as her limbs were still shaking. She said that because it was already late at night and the bus had just departed from the interchange, there were not many passengers on board. They were all seated. She ensured that the passengers were alright before they alighted to continue their journey.

SMRT Trains,Safety/Accident,Neutral ,"A 36 year-old Canadian was fined $600 for trespassing the train captain’s cabin and for attempting to open the emergency door to ""escape"" just because he thought that the trains were too crowded. Peter Anthony Kampos, 35, managed to open the cabin by following the instructions found on the door, once inside, he noticed a second door and tried to open it but was unable to do so. Station control manager of Tanjong Pagar MRT station, Abdul Malek Mohamed Soad, was alerted to the incident when a passenger pressed the emergency communication button in the train. He found Kampos crouching in the corner of the driver’s cabin. 

The man was charged for breaking two rules under the Rapid Transit System Regulations. As the man was in Singapore under a social visit pass, he could not find anyone to bail him out and he had appealed to the court to lower the fine amount as well. Should the man fail to pay the fine, he will be jailed for two days.

VP CIC, Mr Patrick Nathan said safeguards are in place to prevent unauthorised entry to the driver’s cabins. He added that the driver’s cabin is protected by an alert system that allows immediate action in the case of an intrusion. “The safety of all passengers is our utmost concern. Any intruders to the empty driver’s (cabin) would not be able to affect the operations of the train. In the case mentioned, our safeguards led to the swift detection and the arrest of the intruder,” he said.

SMRT Corporate,Financials,Negative,"SMRT announced after the market closed yesterday that it may invest up to $34.5 million in OMGtel, on the condition that the latter wins the fourth telco licence. The amount may be small compared with the $1 billion that a new mobile network could cost. But both companies are also looking to work exclusively together to derive synergies from SMRT's ""extensive media presence and commuter reach"", among other things.

TODAY reported that the telco and transport analysts said they were surprised by the announcements, which they felt was unlikely to go down well with commuters, given how SMRT has not gotten a handle on service disruptions to its core business. Any foray into the telco industry is seen as an even further leap, compared with how the operator is dabbling in retail, the analysts said. However, some felt that SMRT could tap on its network of train stations and bus interchanges should it get the license. 

Transport expert Lee Der Horng said “SMRT could use its distribution network to reach out to end-users. More people are taking public transport. Imagine if, today, you’re at the train station and there’s a mobile phone service centre for you to do whatever transactions you need to do.” Economist Walter Theseria said “As a public company, they (SMRT) obviously have a motivation to look for new revenue sources, especially with the changes.. Their revenue stream may not be as secure as it used to be.”

SMRT Corporate,Financials,Negative,"Consistel chairman Mr Masoud Bassiri said that OMGTel (OMG) will not just make up the numbers and be content with being the fourth telco in Singapore in terms of market share. Another company that had thrown its hat in the ring to be the fourth telco, MyRepublic, had earlier stated it wanted to corner 10 to 15 per cent of the market. Mr Masoud said Consistel will have “quite a bit of ambition” in wresting its share of the market as it aims to be at least in third place. It will also look for board members that would share this ambition going forward.

SMRT share price increased 5.5 cents to reach 1.685 yesterday. SMRT had earlier announced its exclusive partnership with OMGTEL to bid for Singapore's fourth telco license and right after that, analysts at Kim Eng Securities gave SMRT a ""Hold"" rating with a target share price of 1.60 noting that if the partnership works well, it will potentially bode well for SMRT, however as details are not available at the current juncture, they are unable to analyse how the partnership will impact SMRT's profit.

Forum,,,"Forum writer Mr Patrick Tan Siong Kuan noted in this forum letter that he was appalled to learn that SMRT has plans of going into the telco business even before SMRT could get the bus and train services running properly. He noted that one of the reasons for frequent train breakdowns was that SMRT had underinvested in maintenance because they were preoccupied with profits and growing its retail business. He added, despite the poor service, fare increases continued to be explained by increases in operating cost. He thinks that SMRT should be spending money to fix these problems or pass the money back to commuters instead of investing in something not related to its core business. He also expressed disappointment at LTA for allowing these excesses to continue and urged LTA to exercise their right to change SMRT's business and operating model."
SMRT Buses,Customer Service ,Positive ,"A new function launched yesterday in LTA's MyTransport.SG app will now provide commuters with bus loading information, along with estimated bus arrival timings to help commuters decide is they would like to continue waiting for the arriving bus. Passenger loading information will be colour coded with green indicating that seats are available, yellow indicating that standing space is available while red means that the bus is crowded. LTA has also been working with operators SBS Transit and SMRT over the past year to install and test a new centralised system to capture in real-time where buses are and this will provide more accurate bus arrival timings."
SMRT Buses,Regulations,Neutral ,"These were the recent developments to the complaints against SBST premium bus service 564.

According to LTA regulations. For premium bus services, all passengers have to be seated and the bus driver has the rights to forbid passengers from boarding a bus that is already full. An argument broke out when SBS Transit deployed a newer bus model with only 30 seats because the old bus model with 46 seats was due to be scrapped. Due to the change, five passengers could not find seats on the bus and could only stand, but the bus driver refused to drive off, causing unhappiness. In response, SBS Transit deployed two 35-seater busses for Premium Bus Service 564 the following day. When asked what could be done to prevent a recurrence of such incidents, LTA merely said that SBST was not in breach of its bus service license as operators have the discretion to decide on the capacity of buses used based on expected demand for the service.

Rival bus operator SMRT said for its premium services, it uses mostly 12-metre buses that seat 34-38 passengers or articulated buses that seat 59. Only two out of 10 of its services make use of smaller 19-seater buses, “because of the narrow roads in the residential estates along their routes”. Passengers pay up to $7 for a ride on a premium bus and are not guaranteed seats. Standing is not allowed on such buses.

When asked what could be done to prevent a recurrence of such incidents, LTA merely said that SBST was not in breach of its bus service license as operators have the discretion to decide on the capacity of buses used based on expected demand for the service.

Rival bus operator SMRT said for its premium services, it uses mostly 12-metre buses that seat 34-38 passengers or articulated buses that seat 59. Only two out of 10 of its services make use of smaller 19-seater buses, “because of the narrow roads in the residential estates along their routes”. Passengers pay up to $7 for a ride on a premium bus and are not guaranteed seats. Standing is not allowed on such buses.

Forum,,,"Replying to an earlier forum letter , ""SMRT should focus on transport business"", Mr Patrick Nathan, Vice-President, Corporate Information and Communications, SMRT said that SMRT remains fully committed to running a world-class public transport public transport system for Singaporeans and is currently undertaking a complete asset and infrastructure upgrade and renewal programme. Since 2011, SMRT have increased its engineer and technician workforce by 64 per cent and 21 per cent respectively. We are working with various education partners to ensure the sustainability of this workforce in the years to come. VP CIC also highlighted the various initiatives that we are undertaking in the near future that will support our core mission and the transport business.

He added that  different resources will be used to support SMRT’s partnership with OMGTEL. This partnership complements SMRT’s extensive media and commuter reach while simultaneously serving to enhance the travel experience of commuters. It is an extension of the transport business.

SMRT Buses,Regulations,Neutral ,"ST senior transport correspondent Christopher Tan wrote an opinion piece on the premium bus service that made news last week, when some passengers were told to disembark the bus after there are insufficient seats.

In essence, he commented that as a matter of principle and policy, a public transport operator should cater to peak demand, but at the same time, they are private entities answerable to their shareholders, and running a bigger vehicle than needed by the regulatory framework will incur higher running costs.

He opined that for consistency and clarity, the Government should include these so-called non-basic services (premium bus services) in the new bus contracting model. He said it would be strange if commuters of normal bus services enjoy predictability, while premium bus customers do not.

SMRT Buses,Labour,Positive ,"This article is an interview with three bus drivers from China who have come all the way to Singapore to become a bus driver under the largest private bus company, Woodlands Transport. They shared on the reasons why they decided to come to Singapore to work and also the difficulties they faced being new to the job. The reporter mentioned that manpower shortage was one of the reasons why bus companies had to hire foreign bus drivers 

In 2013, out of the 1900 bus drivers hired by SMRT, 58% were Singapore citizens or PR while the other 42% were from Malaysia or China. When the three drivers were asked on their thoughts about the SMRT drivers’ strike in 2012, they unanimously disagreed with their act and believed that there are better solutions to solve the problem.

Forum,,,"Forum writer “Paul Antony Fernandez” wrote that as a daily train commuter, he was upset that instead of improving operations and reducing train disruptions, SMRT appeared concerned only with maximising profit and venturing into the telco industry. He expressed disappointment that commuters have to bear with a train operator that does not see the urgency of looking into train disruptions and solving the problem but is more concerned about maximising profits for shareholders. He urged the authorities to look into how public transport should be operated and managed.

SMRT Corporate,Customer Service ,Positive ,"The two transport operators have both started to launch new platforms since last month to communicate messages to the public and the commuters more efficiently through the use of social and online media. 

The article noted that, since mid-last month, SMRT have started a blog page on their official website uploading blog posts written by their senior management and also share some ""behind the scenes"" information about train operations at different MRT stations. Mr Patrick Nathan, SMRT's Vice-President of Corporate Information and Communications noted that, in order to provide better and more reliable services for our commuters, we started the SMRT blog to provide more information for the passengers and subsequently, we will be sharing information regarding the different modes of public transport through the blog and explain how public transport services are operated. He added that they hope to allow commuters to understand the efforts that staff at SMRT put in to enhance the ride experience through the use of blogs and social media. 

The article also extracted quotes from the blog entry by Mr Lee Ling Wee, Managing Director, SMRT Trains who noted the hard work put in by the company in enhancing services. “Believe me when I say that the SMRT management remains committed to achieving much higher levels of rail reliability. We will get there. We want to do it. We really do. If we fall short, we will try harder and be better…SMRT has embarked on its journey to achieve this. It will take several years but we are confident of delivering a safe and reliable network. We want to. We will.”

The article quoted a commuter - bank employee Chen Qian Ying, 21, felt that it was good to see senior management personally writing blog entries. “At least it shows humility and sincerity on the part of the senior management. As a commuter, it makes it easier for me to accept the explanation.”

In the same article, it was shared that SBST has launched a Twitter account under the name @SBSTransit_Ltd

An LTA spokesman said the move is part of ""continuous efforts to ensure the safety and reliability of rail services"" and the assessment builds on the studies that LTA conducted two years ago. Observers welcome the new check as the number of major breakdowns hit a four-year high of 12 last year.

Veteran transport consultant Bruno Wildermuth said: “We obviously  need an independent assessment. To what degree outsiders can give a valid opinion will depend a lot on the access that they will have to the systems, the operators’ staff as well as maintenance records. But equally important will be the background experience of the outside consultant. Somebody like the British Rail Inspectorate or an experienced operator such as the Hong Kong MTR might able to do the job.”

ST senior transport correspondent Christopher Tan also highlighted that both SMRT and the LTA “are baffled” as to why the Kranji-Yew Tee stretch is the most problematic section of the North-South Line. So far this year, there have been seven breakdowns arising from faults there, lasting between five minutes and nearly five hours.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"Breakdowns have been rather frequent along the North-South Line, between Yew Tee and Kranji MRT Station. From January this year, there have already been six breakdowns related to the tracks. 


SMRT Trains’ Managing Director Mr Lee Ling Wee noted in a SMRT blog post he wrote yesterday that the stretch of track from Yew Tee to Kranji seems to have more issues and had recorded six track-related faults since January. The shortest delay was 5 minutes long while the longest took 4 hours and 42 minutes to fix, largely due to a thunderstorm which delayed access by our maintenance team to perform the repairs. Mr Lee added that the track faults from February to March were mainly due to defective 3rd rail components and these have since been inspected and rectified. He also pointed out that the Yew Tee to Kranji stretch has been prone to lightning strikes and therefore they have installed lightning arrestors along this stretch to protect trackside infrastructure from lightning strikes. He said ""We are doing a thorough review of the issues related to track infrastructure such as permanent way and signalling equipment along this stretch. Meanwhile, we will ensure our maintenance teams are on standby to respond to issues in this area – especially during peak hours – to ensure that recovery can be faster in the event of an incident.”

SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Positive ,"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SMRT issued a joint statement announcing that the sleeper replacement programme on the North-South Line will be completed by the end of this month, one month ahead of schedule. Train services will return to their full speed. On the other hand, sleeper replacement works on the East West Line will commence in mid-May 2015. In preparation for this, SMRT has started implementing speed restrictions on certain stretches along the East West Line. During the sleeper replacement works along the East West Line, SMRT will be constructing sound barriers to reduce the noise level and to ensure that the works can proceed safely and efficiently. Services at some of the train stations will probably end early to facilitate works as well. 

SMRT Trains Managing Director, Mr Lee Ling Wee noted that the company is grateful for the patience and understanding from residents and North South Line commuters during the sleeper replacement works and SMRT have gotten valuable experience which would help enhance the sleeper replacement programme for the East West Line. He added that, speed limits will have to be implemented during the sleeper replacement works and this might bring inconvenience to the commuters, therefore SMRT will continue to work closely with the residents and commuters.

SMRT Buses,Safety/Accident,Negative,"SMRT Bus Service 961 was heading towards Geylang from Woodlands Friday afternoon braked abruptly at a junction along Jalan Bukit Merah. Many passengers tumbled from their seats or lost their balance and fell. One of the passengers, Mr Deng Jian Xiang, said the driver looked like he was trying to speed past an amber light but realised he wasn’t going to be able to make it. He also said the bus driver got up to help some of the passengers back to their seats and briefly checked that everyone was alright before he went back to the driver seat without explaining what happened. He finally pulled over and called for an ambulance when passengers started to complain that they were not feeling well. Two passengers were sent to SGH. One of them, Mdm Deng Xiu Qin had to undergo a surgery due to a fractured ankle. Her family had expressed their displeasure and anger saying no one from the bus company came to the hospital to check on Mdm Deng’s condition but instead only communicated through the phone that the compensation department would be contacting them. SMRT’s Vice President for Corporate Information and Communications, Mr Patrick Nathan confirmed the incident and noted that according to the report from the bus captain, he stepped on the brakes at the junction. Investigations are still ongoing and the customer relations department will be in contact with the two ladies who suffered injuries to extend support and help to them. He apologised for the inconvenience caused to the passengers and reaffirmed that SMRT will continue to ensure that bus services are safe for the passengers."

SMRT Buses,Safety/Accident,Negative,"The bus captain for the SMRT bus service 960 was quoted saying that the left corner of the upper deck of the bus hit protruding tree branches along Bukit Timah Road. This caused the windows on the upper deck of the bus to break, injuring three passengers on board. He called for an ambulance and they were taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for treatment. He also said that in his 28 years of bus driving experience he had never encountered an incident like this.

SMRT Corporate,CSR,Positive ,"SBS Transit (SBST) and SMRT announced free train and bus rides on this year's national day. In a joint statement yesterday they said commuters will be able to enjoy both train and bus rides without having to tap their transit cards from the start to the end of service hours on Aug 9. Fare gates leading to train services run by SMRT and SBST will be opened to allow people to board trains on multiple train lines for free. The free services include both the operators’ trunk and feeder bus services, as well as SMRT’s Night Rider service and all SBST’s non-basic services, such as Parks, Chinatown Direct and Night Owl bus services.

Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport chairman Cedric Foo said he hopes commuters will take advantage of the free rides to attend as many events as they can and be part of the celebrations. “The public transport operators will absorb the cost. It is not a small sum, but this is what they do as part of corporate social responsibility on this auspicious, important day,” he said.

Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew welcomed the move in a Facebook post yesterday. He said it will allow commuters to get to different venues for National Day celebrations without having to worry about parking or congestion. He added that the LTA will work with SBST and SMRT to make necessary adjustments to cater for increased travel demand.

SMRT president and group chief executive officer Desmond Quek said: “As we celebrate a milestone in the Singapore story, free travel on National Day will provide a boost to Singapore’s jubilee birthday celebrations held islandwide.”

SBST chief executive Gan Juay Kiat said: “We hope that this will add to the celebratory atmosphere and encourage everyone to get out of the house to celebrate as one united people.”

Fare gates leading to train services run by SMRT and SBST will be opened to allow people to board trains on multiple train lines for free. The free services include both the operators’ trunk and feeder bus services, as well as SMRT’s Night Rider service and all SBST’s non-basic services, such as Parks, Chinatown Direct and Night Owl bus services.

Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport chairman Cedric Foo said he hopes commuters will take advantage of the free rides to attend as many events as they can and be part of the celebrations. “The public transport operators will absorb the cost. It is not a small sum, but this is what they do as part of corporate social responsibility on this auspicious, important day,” he said.

Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew welcomed the move in a Facebook post yesterday. He said it will allow commuters to get to different venues for National Day celebrations without having to worry about parking or congestion. He added that the LTA will work with SBST and SMRT to make necessary adjustments to cater for increased travel demand.

SMRT president and group chief executive officer Desmond Quek said: “As we celebrate a milestone in the Singapore story, free travel on National Day will provide a boost to Singapore’s jubilee birthday celebrations held islandwide.”

SBST chief executive Gan Juay Kiat said: “We hope that this will add to the celebratory atmosphere and encourage everyone to get out of the house to celebrate as one united people.”

It said this was the third case of a shoe coming dislodged, thus breaking contact with the third rail, in five months. The two most recent incidents happened to new trains that were delivered just last June 14.
SMRT VP (Circle Line and Bukit Panjang LRT) Chia Chun Wah said: “Our investigation team traced the cause of the power trip on the Bukit Panjang LRT system to a dislodged collector shoe. We are still investigating how it got dislodged.” 
Rail industry watchers said the undulating terrain and sharp corners along the LRT’s alignment could exert undue pressure on collector shoes. A commuter was interviewed and said that the disruptions have become more frequent.

SMRT Corporate,Financials,Positive ,"These were the news reports of the full year results for SMRT Corporation Ltd.

SMRT Corporation achieved a 6.2% revenue growth to $1.24 million and posted a 47% rise in net earnings to $91 million for the full year ended March 31, 2015. SMRT posted a 23 per cent year-on-year increase in its fourth-quarter net profit to S$20.8 million, buoyed by higher ridership and average fare. This was on the back of group revenue climbing 7.5 per cent to S$311.2 million, due to a rise in income from both its fare and non-fare businesses. Revenue from its fare business (comprising train, LRT, and bus operations) rose 5.3 per cent, boosted by a 9.9 per cent increase in revenue from its bus operations. Meanwhile, the group's non-fare business experienced a 13.3 per cent increase in revenue. 

All the dailies carried the fact that the MRT division incurred its first ever quarterly loss. ST reports that the MRT business is more profitable for the full year than in the previous 12 months, by posting an operating profit of $13.4 million, up from $5.5 million, on the back of increased ridership and fare rise. Lower electricity cost and higher productivity gains helped as well.  Losses at LRT division widened to $3.8 million from higher repair and maintenance cost, as well as costs associated with the new LRT trains. Engineering services incurred a loss of $2.4 million, possibly its first, from a profit of $3.8 million because of start-up expenses at Singapore Rail Engineering. 

Group CEO and President Desmond Kuek said SMRT is expanding its non-fare business beyond Singapore, but “our core focus remains with the intensified efforts to renew and upgrade our ageing rail systems.”

Using Beeline, commuters will be assured of a seat. The two participating private bus companies are Bus-Plus services under SMRT and Aedge Holdings.  The plan for initializing the application’s launch is still in its developmental phase as issues such as bus routes, the maximum passenger capacities for the buses and the number of days in advance for bookings to be made have yet to be finalized. Requests for suggestions to resolve these issues have since been posted on the beeline webpage and 1500 different suggestions have been received. 

Shin Min Daily reported that Bus –Plus and Aedge will formulate bus routes based on public suggestions and research, so as to maximize the number of commuters who will benefit from the new service.

SMRT Trains,Labour,Positive ,"Public sector agencies and government-linked companies (GLCs) are implementing a slew of measures to draw and retain engineering talent in their fold, with many going beyond pay hikes. Many companies are now turning their focus towards professional development and career progression in order to reduce the engineer attrition rate. A dearth of engineers, coupled with growing demand for them from the considerable number of government infrastructure projects initiated in the last two years, has triggered this flurry of moves to court them. This mismatch between supply and demand has since been keenly felt.

Companies like SMRT Corporation have opened up career pathways to appeal to applicants keen on management roles and also to those who prefer technical roles. The public transport operator has since adopted a dual track where engineers may take up both corporate and specialist roles. Having also ""aggressively"" bumped up its engineers' salaries by about 20 per cent in the last two years, it has halved its attrition rate for engineers since 2012. The company hopes to grow its rail engineer team from 288 to 355 in the next two years.

SMRT rolled out a career roadmap for engineers last Friday which seeks to formalize the professional development of its engineers through post graduate degree courses, industry attachments, mentorship and by offering help with accreditation.

The article discusses current issues facing the taxi industry such as the competition for drivers and passengers with the emergence of electric cars by HDT Singapore Holdings, a local agent of vehicle and battery maker BYD, who is a licensed taxi operator and employs drivers who hold a Taxi Driver’s Vocational License to ensure safety of passengers. It adds that taxi operators such as ComfortDelGro and SMRT Corp buys cars and lease them out to drivers for a monthly fee, where else HDT pays drivers a fixed salary. Meanwhile the rise of car-booking apps such as Uber might spawn a broader revamp of private vehicle ownership in Singapore.

Taxi,Financials,Positive ,"The article discusses the recent performance of ComfortDelGro and SMRT taxi operations, increasing competition face and some recent service enhancements introduced.  The article states that taxi operations are very important to the growth and profitability of both ComfortDelGro and SMRT. Local taxi operations made up 25% of total revenue and 24.2% of operating earnings at ComfortDelGro in the first quarter of this year. At SMRT, taxi operations made up 16.6% of revenue and 17.2% of operating earnings from profitable business groups.  With the popularity of taxi apps such as GrabTaxi and Uber, the competition for drivers is heating up. ComfortDelGro launched a booking app with better user interface and incentivised cashless payments by introducing a CabRewards programme. Last June, the company partnered with the Health Promotion Board to conduct health screening for drivers and offer free access on Wednesdays to facilities like gyms and swimming pools. SMRT, meanwhile, partnered with London-based mobile taxi app developer to launch Hailo taxi booking app and announced an enhanced training programme for its drivers. It has introduced the Pruis Hyhbrid to its fleet hoping t o attract drivers with lower fuel costs, and continued to play up its wheelchair friendly taxis."

SMRT Trains,Labour,Positive ,"ST Senior Correspondent Christopher Tan had an exclusive interview with with SMRT President and Group CEO Mr Desmond Kuek had with. In the article, Mr Kuek recounts that he was put to the test almost immediately after his appointment with several major issues, including a major rail breakdown and a bus driver’s strike. It also says that his earlier assessment of the company was damning, describing it as having ""deep-seated issues... managerial, structural, cultural and systemic issues"".  The article highlights steps taken to put SMRT back on track, including increasing the number of technicians and engineers significantly; introducing clearer employee career pathways; rail renewal and upgrade works; and train upgrades. When all the upgrading is done and with the ""robust preventive and predictive maintenance regimen"" the company is putting in place, Mr Kuek is confident SMRT will rise from its recent chequered history to recapture its spot as one of the world's top metros. Although he does not say it outright, it is clear he does not think Singapore can support more rail operators. Mr Kuek said ""It takes five to 10 years to groom an experienced rail engineer. The question of who will run upcoming new lines does place some uncertainty on an operator. Should it invest in growing the expertise for the future? There is a very real risk of incurring the cost of raising the manpower but not winning the licence."" He looks to Hong Kong as one success story, where a tightly regulated operator derives synergy from a fleet of trains that can be deployed on any line. Nevertheless, he concedes that ""each city evolves its own system based on its socio-economic and political considerations"", and there is no one size that fits all. There is also a box story titled “Third-rail works start next month”. SMRT expects to start replacing the EWL’s power-supplying third rail next month. The project will be undertaken by local contractor Gates PCM for S$13mil, and SMRT will call for a tender for a similar project on the NSL soon. It said the sagging of the third-rail were singled out as the main cause of two massive breakdowns in 2011. The article also discusses other on-going rail renewal works, such as sleeper replacement, replacement of signaling systems, and arrival of new trains. "

However, the judge ruled that the defendant did not commit any crime as the price was decided based on mutual agreement. SMRT Taxis staff were called on in court to provide statements on whether SMRT  allows its staff to charge taxi fares based on agreements and not the taxi meters. It was revealed that SMRT does not allow drivers to charge passengers without the taxi meter. However the court ruled in favour of the defendant as no such legal documentation of the rule can be found. Additionally the LTA officers had agreed to the taxi fare pricing.

Other operators such as Go-Ahead, Woodlands Transport, RATP Dev Transdev Asia and Keolis have also expressed interest in bidding for the contract in the tender, which closes on Aug 14. Both SBS Transit and SMRT are likely to bid too. Asked how confident Kumho is of clinching the Loyang package against competition from bigger and more experienced city bus operators, Mr Han Myung Ho, the deputy general manager of Kumho Buslines said: “ We’re not intimidated by the size of other bidders. We have more than 2,000 buses in our tour fleet, which makes us No.1 in Korea. And as a group, Kumho is very big.”  Mr Han and his team have been spending time understanding bus routes and commuter need. They have also been meeting with local companies to better understand the Singapore environment. Transport analysts have since said that it is little surprise that more foreign players are keen to get a piece of the pie here in Singapore. The second tender is expected to be more competitive than the first. Professor Lee Der Horng from the National University of Singapore’s department of Civil and Environmental Engineering has said that it does not make sense that bidders will underbid in this second tender given that the package price has provided potential bidders with a good benchmark..

SMRT Corporate,Labour,Neutral ,"Many workers in the public sector consider the $500 special bonus in conjunction with Singapore's Golden Jubilee (SG50) as a sweet surprise, acknowledging their contribution towards nation building. Prior to this, NTUC has called for companies to give SG50 bonus. DBS Bank will be giving a cash bonus of $1,000 to staff from vice presidents and below. SMRT will be giving shopping vouchers worth $500 each to 8,400 workers."
SMRT Corporate,Financials,Neutral ,"If the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) spreads further in Asean, airline, hotel, and mass public transport stocks would be among the hardest hit, said Nomura in a report on Monday. In Singapore, these would include tourism-related stocks such as Singapore Airlines, Tiger Airways, Mandarin Oriental international, Hotel Properties, and Hotel Grand Central. And with individuals reluctant to be in crowded places, Nomura added that other stocks that could have the most impact are those in retail trade and restaurants, hospitals, and public entertainment. It named Genting Singapore, Raf?es Medical Group, SMRT Corp, SBS Transit, and Metro Holdings as Singapore-listed groups likely to be affected. “Still, we would expect the impact to be temporary as, based on information so far, we expect the spread of Mers to be brought under control fairly rapidly,” said Nomura analyst Mixo das. Mr Das stressed that historically, the impact of disease outbreaks on stocks tends to run ahead of actual economic costs or impact on human life. As long as the outbreak is contained quickly and limited in scope, Mr Das said, Mers is likely to have only a temporary and one-off effect, thus presenting a buying opportunity.

Taxi,Regulations,Neutral ,"Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan highlighted that transport apps providers like Uber and GrabTaxi are leading the charge in a revolution that is rising slowly but surely in the taxi industry. For decades, the industry has been a cocooned sector controlled by giants such as ComfortDelGro and SMRT. Even when the industry was liberalised 12 years ago, paving the way for a number of new players to enter the fray, it did not change the status quo dramatically.

Despite the increased taxi population by approximately 45 per cent, taxi commuters still complain of not being able to get a cab at odd hours of the day. Some people struggle to get a cab during Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) hours.

These commuter dissatisfaction have in turn led them to turn to transport app providers. The writer states that predicts that companies like Uber and Grab Taxi will disrupt the taxi industry. 

Just four months ago, Uber set up a wholly owned rental company, which rents out oldish cars at rates that are half the rate for taxis of a similar age. Grab Taxi is also following suit. It is now cheaper to rent a taxi from these companies as compared to renting from incumbent operators.

Despite the fact that call-booking jobs currently account for only 20 per cent of all taxi rides, Christopher Tan warns that it will not be long before this percentage grow.

The article cites smartphone technology, rising affluence, the introduction of distance –based ERP as factors which will enable the growth of these transport apps providers.

Dangers such as safety and security were also highlighted as main concerns surrounding the rise of these parallel taxis.

One main concern that continues to haunt consumers is whether these parallel taxis are adequately covered by insurance to reflect the risks drivers, passengers and third parties face. If they are, the insurance premiums they pay should be similar to regular taxis. If so why are parallel taxis so much cheaper?

Christopher Tan concludes by suggesting that Uber and GrabTaxi are in fact on-call taxis providers and they should be regulated as such. If proper regulation is not performed, there will be little barriers for entry into the taxi industry and Singapore might see itself transported back to the era of “pirate” taxis.

Taxi,Labour,Neutral ,"A high-level committee overseeing and promoting workplace health has laid out its plans to reach more than 120,000 workers in business clusters islandwide by March next year. The Tripartite Oversight Committee (TOC) on Workplace Health will also focus on encouraging employers to look at safety, health and well-being together at their workplaces, and working with unions and companies to develop programmes to reach 11,000 mature workers in priority sectors such as transport. Senior Minister of State for Health and Manpower Amy Khor, who chairs the committee, said that the committee is partnering developers and companies at business clusters to improve workers’ access to healthy lifestyle options. This approach allows the programmes to target the specific health needs and work environments of individual health sectors.The committee also plans to extend the pilot programme in the transport sector, which has reached around 3,000 taxi drivers at SMRT Taxi’s Customer Service Centre and Comfort DelGro’s Taxi Service Centre, to other service centres.

SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Positive ,"The Bukit Panjang LRT will be upgraded in the coming months, to improve the reliability of a system that has been hit by a spate of disruptions this year. SMRT and LTA yesterday gave details on what they would focus on to solve the recurring problems on the 16-year-old line. They concluded that most of the breakdowns were caused by problems related to the tracks, signalling system and traction power system. 

SMRT Trains managing director Mr Lee Ling Wee said SMRT will work closely with the LTA on a “holistic comprehensive review of the total transport needs” of the residents in Bukit Panjang, given the increase in the precinct’s population. These enhancements include replacing the power rail brackets at crossings to address the issue of traction power tripping and loss of power to train cars. 
Cameras will be installed under train cars to monitor the alignment and contact between the power-drawing collector shoes and power rails.

SMRT will work with manufacturer Bombardier on a remote reset feature for train cars to allow for quicker recovery when the service is down.Additionally, SMRT will be hiring more staff and adding two additional exit-only platforms at Choa Chu Kang LRT station.

Mr Lee said the operator would bear the full cost of the measures. He declined to reveal the exact amount only saying that it “runs in the millions.”LTA and SMRT said that in the longer term, they will embark on a detailed study of the system.Transport analysts noted that the enhancement measures announced yesterday would bring some relief to commuters.

Cameras will be installed under train cars to monitor the alignment and contact between the power-drawing collector shoes and power rails.

SMRT will work with manufacturer Bombardier on a remote reset feature for train cars to allow for quicker recovery when the service is down.Additionally, SMRT will be hiring more staff and adding two additional exit-only platforms at Choa Chu Kang LRT station.

Mr Lee said the operator would bear the full cost of the measures. He declined to reveal the exact amount only saying that it “runs in the millions.”LTA and SMRT said that in the longer term, they will embark on a detailed study of the system.Transport analysts noted that the enhancement measures announced yesterday would bring some relief to commuters. However, these were focused mainly on the engineering aspects, and the LTA and SMRT may need to look at improving accessibility and comfort for commuters"

SMRT Trains,Facilities ,Positive ,"Four new trains have been added to the Circle Line to help boost capacity and reduce waiting times. The new trains will increase capacity by 10 per cent and commuters can look forward to shorter waits and less crowded rides, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) yesterday. Compared with the current fleet of 40, the new trains will have more strap-hangers for passengers to hold on to, and gap fillers - which are rubber strips to reduce the gap between the platform edge and the train floor.

Twenty more will join the fleet by the middle of next year. Seven trains that will be deployed later this year are undergoing testing at the Kim Chuan Depot. Ridership on the Circle Line has been growing in the past few years. Operator SMRT said that as of last month, the daily ridership was 398,000- 11 per cent more than the 398, 000 in May last year and 13 per cent more than the 351,000 in May 2013."

Twenty more will join the fleet by the middle of next year. Seven trains that will be deployed later this year are undergoing testing at the Kim Chuan Depot. Ridership on the Circle Line has been growing in the past few years. Operator SMRT said that as of last month, the daily ridership was 398,000- 11 per cent more than the 398, 000 in May last year and 13 per cent more than the 351,000 in May 2013."
SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Positive ,"The troubled Bukit Panjang LRT (BPLRT) system will undergo a ""mid-life overhaul"" by 2019 to improve its performance, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew told Bukit Panjang residents yesterday. Its frequent breakdowns have emerged as a top concern in the area. He claimed that the Transport Ministry will spend the next 12 months studying the changes needed to keep the system reliable, before spending the next few years improving it. At the same time, new train cars have been progressively added since last year, while older cars will be retrofitted with a new remote reset system so they can be reactivated more quickly. Operator SMRT will also deploy more personnel across the LRT stations to rectify faults at a faster pace, he added.Acknowledging that more work needed to be done to improve the reliability of train and bus services in Bukit Panjang, especially in light of the area’s growing resident population, Mr Lui reiterated SMRT’s recently announced plans to improve the BPLRT system.

Last Thursday SMRT unveiled a slew of initiatives, such as replacing power rail brackets and hiring more operations and maintenance staff  to address the system faults."

SMRT Trains,Labour,Positive ,"SMRT has started the MSRT Train Engineer Professionalisation (STEP), a new training and career development programme, to raise the skills of its engineers, in the wake of a spate of train breakdowns and service delays.

SMRT Trains Managing Director Lee Ling Wee said: “Admittedly, we are doing quite a fair amount of ‘fire-fighting’ at this point in time. But we do not intend to remain in this reactive mode forever.” To do that, SMRT’s rail engineers need to be more proactive and work alongside the rail system. More time will be spent analysing data and developing engineering solutions before a problem occurs, rather than after, Lee explained.

Under STEP, engineers who have been with SMRT, for over five years will undergo three months’ training to equip them with the latest technical and industry know-how, as well as sharpen their leadership chops. The first batch of 22 participants began their training on June 24. Newer hires will join a two and a half month programme on rail engineering fundamentals.The framework also allows SMRT’s engineers to move into diverse rail engineering works, such as system engineers, specialist engineers and business development and management engineers. This gives them a clearer idea of how they can develop their career towards the specialization they want. “We understand our engineers may not want to do engineering works for their entire career. Some of them may want to value-add in other areas after a number of years as rail engineers. This is okay with us,” Lee says.SMRT will also be offering chartership for its rail engineers. The management said last month that it would consider “giving some form of recognition in the form of remuneration“ to those who become chartered engineers.

Taxi,Regulations,Negative,"Only one of the six cab companies here has met taxi availability standards set by the transport authorities. Comfort managed to fully meet the requirements, while CityCab, TransCab and Premier had lapses. 

SMRT and Prime failed to meet the standards and will be fined, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said yesterday. SMRT has been fined around $45,000 for failing to meet standards in the first two months of the January to April review period, while Prime has to pay about $44,000 for flunking in the first three months. They have two weeks to pay the fines, which are based on a firm's fleet size.SMRT spokesman Patrick Nathan said the company had been “stepping up efforts” to help its cabbies log the minimum daily mileage of 250km.

A recent initiative is the introduction of a taxi availability mileage counter….which serves to help (drivers) monitor their travelled mileage,” he added.

Besides meeting the minimum daily mileage, taxi operators have to make sure a high percentage of their fleet is operating during peak hours. For instance, from 7am to 11am and 5pm to 11pm, 85 percent of cabs have to be on the road-up from 70 per cent when the standards were first introduced in 2013.Taxi companies are required to pass standards for both indicators in at least four months in every six month period to be allowed to grow their fleet, with growth capped at 2 per cent per annum.

The LTA’s action comes amid a public debate about how the taxi service can be improved. Many commuters have since welcomed the introduction of taxi app services , like Uber and Grab Taxi, as these offer alternative rides. But taxi operators have argued that the new players are thriving on unfair competition

Taxi,Financials,Neutral ,"Aggressive marketing by GrabTaxi could spell trouble for listed transport players, a report by Maybank Kim Eng revealed.

The report noted that the market could be underestimating the new threat posed by new entrants, which have the capacity to tap almost 21,000 rental cars in the market.

This a credible fleet size when comparing to the 28,792 taxis on the road. ComfortDelGro could be the most affected as its taxi business accounts for 31% of its sales. 

On the other hand, Maybank Kim Eng believes that this competition will not affect SMRT’s business as much as taxi operations account for a smaller portion of the public transport operator’s business."
Forum,,,"Reader, Gurmit Singh Kullar, suggests that the reason authorities have not curbed how new solution providers like Uber, GrabTaxi and other booking app firms operate, is due to the fact that they are helping to meet the demand for taxis. He states that it is the large taxi firms like ComfortDelGro and SMRT which do not seem to care if commuters find a cab, because their revenue model is based on rental fees paid by taxi drivers. He questions the possibility of improvements for commuters and drivers in Singapore’s current situation, whereby the large players in the taxi business have no stake in actually meeting customers' needs, and are unscathed when a taxi driver's daily bottom line is affected by customer volume, weather or traffic conditions."

Forum,,,"Reader, Daniel Ng Peng Keat, said that children with cerebral palsy will initially start out in a stroller but bus regulations require that all strollers be folded when placed on board public buses. This requirement poses a substantial difficulty for the caregiver, as he or she has to remove the child and then fold and place the stroller in a secure position. Meanwhile, other passengers will have to wait for their journey to continue as the bus captain will not drive off until the stroller is folded away. He suggests several alternative solutions  to mitigate the problem, such as providing harnesses to secure the strollers and instructing for bus captains to drive defensively. He hopes that both SBS Transit and SMRT can support the efforts by coming up with ways to help these children and their families."

Tens of thousands of commuters missed dinners with families and other appointments yesterday, as Singaporeans grappled with possibly the country's worst MRT breakdown. 

A power trip crippled train services throughout the North-South and East-West lines for more than two hours from around 7pm, causing commuters to be stranded during the evening peak hour. 

Buses as well as taxis were packed. Free bus services were made available at all stations on both lines at about 7.20pm to ferry commuters caught in the massive disruption, but these proved to be of little relief. 

SMRT said service on the East-West and North-South lines resumed at 9.20pm and 10.35pm respectively, but trains moved slower as a precaution. 

In a statement, the Land Transport Authority said early investigations found a faulty train which could have caused the power trip. Arcing was observed on the underside of this train, and the power surge caused the protective relays across both lines to be activated, causing the shutdown.

“Preliminary assessment points to a possible power-related equipment failure of substations along the track, or the undercarriage of a potential defective train which we are investigating tonight,” said Mr Lee Ling Wee, managing director of SMRT Trains. He added that SMRT is not ruling out other possibilities.

SMRT said last night that it would be working through the night to ensure train services return to normal by Wednesday morning. It also advised commuters to make alternative travel plans, as there exists the possibility that the North-South and East West lines could start with limited services on Wednesday morning.

“Free bus services will continue tomorrow morning and fare gates will open until the resumption of full train services,” SMRT added. 

The massive disruption on SMRT’s North-South and East-West MRT lines lasted for about 3.5 hours on Tuesday evening (Jul 7).

In a Facebook post, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said, “ I am extremely concerned with today’s incident. This is the first time that services on both the North-South and East-West Lines were affected. I am sorry that many commuters experienced massive disruptions to their journeys.” Mr Lui added that he has told SMRT and the LTA to work through the night to “ensure that services run properly’.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"These reports cover the facts of the incident as it happened on the evening of 7 July.

Tens of thousands of commuters missed dinners with families and other appointments yesterday, as Singaporeans grappled with possibly the country's worst MRT breakdown. 

A power trip crippled train services throughout the North-South and East-West lines for more than two hours from around 7pm, causing commuters to be stranded during the evening peak hour. 

Buses as well as taxis were packed. Free bus services were made available at all stations on both lines at about 7.20pm to ferry commuters caught in the massive disruption, but these proved to be of little relief. 

SMRT said service on the East-West and North-South lines resumed at 9.20pm and 10.35pm respectively, but trains moved slower as a precaution. 

In a statement, the Land Transport Authority said early investigations found a faulty train which could have caused the power trip. Arcing was observed on the underside of this train, and the power surge caused the protective relays across both lines to be activated, causing the shutdown.

“Preliminary assessment points to a possible power-related equipment failure of substations along the track, or the undercarriage of a potential defective train which we are investigating tonight,” said Mr Lee Ling Wee, managing director of SMRT Trains. He added that SMRT is not ruling out other possibilities.

SMRT said last night that it would be working through the night to ensure train services return to normal by Wednesday morning. It also advised commuters to make alternative travel plans, as there exists the possibility that the North-South and East West lines could start with limited services on Wednesday morning.

“Free bus services will continue tomorrow morning and fare gates will open until the resumption of full train services,” SMRT added. 

The massive disruption on SMRT’s North-South and East-West MRT lines lasted for about 3.5 hours on Tuesday evening (Jul 7).

In a Facebook post, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said, “ I am extremely concerned with today’s incident. This is the first time that services on both the North-South and East-West Lines were affected. I am sorry that many commuters experienced massive disruptions to their journeys.” Mr Lui added that he has told SMRT and the LTA to work through the night to “ensure that services run properly’.

SMRT said service on the East-West and North-South lines resumed at 9.20pm and 10.35pm respectively, but trains moved slower as a precaution. 

In a statement, the Land Transport Authority said early investigations found a faulty train which could have caused the power trip. Arcing was observed on the underside of this train, and the power surge caused the protective relays across both lines to be activated, causing the shutdown.

“Preliminary assessment points to a possible power-related equipment failure of substations along the track, or the undercarriage of a potential defective train which we are investigating tonight,” said Mr Lee Ling Wee, managing director of SMRT Trains. He added that SMRT is not ruling out other possibilities.

SMRT said last night that it would be working through the night to ensure train services return to normal by Wednesday morning. It also advised commuters to make alternative travel plans, as there exists the possibility that the North-South and East West lines could start with limited services on Wednesday morning.

“Free bus services will continue tomorrow morning and fare gates will open until the resumption of full train services,” SMRT added. 

The massive disruption on SMRT’s North-South and East-West MRT lines lasted for about 3.5 hours on Tuesday evening (Jul 7).

In a Facebook post, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said, “ I am extremely concerned with today’s incident. This is the first time that services on both the North-South and East-West Lines were affected. I am sorry that many commuters experienced massive disruptions to their journeys.” Mr Lui added that he has told SMRT and the LTA to work through the night to “ensure that services run properly’.

•         Mdm Tan lean Ee, 70, was travelling from Marina Bay to Woodlands when she was asked to disembark at City Hall. She said “why every time like that? After they repair (the system) so many times, still like that.”

•         Jaysri Muruviya, 36, was at Braddell and expressed that even though the station staff repeated inform commuters that free buses are available, he did not know which bus to take as he was not familiar with the area and bus routes since he usually just takes the MRT. 

•         Undergraduate Melody Gibson was at Ang Mo Kio station when service was not available. She tried to get a taxi but found that there were about 50 people waiting in line. “The bus interchanges are crowded too. This has happened a number of times already. SMRT should make better plans to prepare for this.” She said. She asked why free shuttle bus services were not activated. 

•         Tan Li Ting, 18, said that while the breakdown was troublesome, she found the station staff “helpful” and “patient”.

•         Taufik Ahmad, 28, was unable to board any of the five buses that went by Buona Vista towards Jurong. “Everyone was dashing for the bus and the situation was quite messy.”

•         Madam Fafa Aris, 50, had trouble taking the bus and felt that more staff would be required. “ I hope to take the bus, but I’m not sure which one to take. Everything is so messy,” she said. 

•         In a seperate Stomp article, Stomper J recounts being stuck in a crowded MRT train at Bishan station this evening (7 July) at around 6.50pm. She was on her way from Braddell station to Ang Mo Kio station when the MRT train suddenly stopped at Bishan station for about 15 to 20 minutes. At around 7.15pm, she learnt from a screen outside Bishan MRT station train services have resumed. The delay was believed to have been caused by a track fault.

The Singapore Civil Defence Force responded to calls for assistance at Bishan, Braddell and Khatib stations yesterday evening. Train services on the East-West and North-South lines resumed at 9.20pm and 10.35pm respectively, but trains moved at lower speeds as a precaution.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"Stressing the need to get to the bottom of the cause of today’s (July 7) massive breakdown, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said he was “extremely concerned” with the disruption that had crippled both the North-South and East-West lines at the same time. On his Facebook page, he wrote last night that it was “too early to conclude definitively” on what could have caused the incident, which he noted was the first time that both lines had been crippled simultaneously.

The LTA said it has sent its engineers to help SMRT with its recovery efforts and would be working with the public transport operator to ensure services run properly today. A full investigation into the incident will be carried out, it added.

Separately, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Chan Chun Sing called on affected commuters to “pull together”.

There are also car owners who have posted offers… to pick up those who need a ride. It’s late, and I know it’s not easy, but let’s pull together.”

SMRT Corporate,Financials,Neutral ,"After an earlier failed attempt to inject more competition by opening up spectrum for a fourth telco, the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) is making another effort by offering a 60 per cent discount on the starting price of the auction, and limiting participation to only new bidders.  

The IDA is releasing 60MHz of spectrum to the prospective newcomer, out of the 225MHz that will be up for auction early next year.  The rest of the spectrum will be for the current telcos, to meet growing demand for mobile data traffic.

The article highlights that in the past year, fibre broadband provider MyRepublic, as well as transport operator SMRT in collaboration with local tech firm Consistel, have signaled their intent to throw in their bids to become Singapore’s fourth telco.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"These were the press coverage from the joint press conference with LTA held on Wednesday, 8 July

SMRT and the Land Transport Authority held a joint press conference on Wednesday morning. Both SMRT chief executive Desmond Kuek and LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong apologised for the disruption, which affected over 250,000 commuters. 

'We would like to apologise to commuters and all who were inconvenienced by the ??MRT disruptions,"" said SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek at the press conference. In response to the service breakdown, Chew Men Leong, LTA chief executive, also apologized for the incident and claimed that they need some time to investigate the incident due to the massive system. 

He added that the SMRT engineers have worked overnight to find out the root cause of the power trip.

SMRT Corp has identified three possible causes of Tuesday's unprecedented breakdown on the North-South and East-West lines: worn cable insulation, tunnel water leakage, and a glitch in a power substation. It pointed to these possible causes at a media conference yesterday but said it was ""not 100 per cent sure"" that they led to the breakdown, and that it was continuing investigations to determine if there are other causes. 

Asked if these potential flaws would have been picked up during routine checks, SMRT Trains managing director Lee Ling Wee said : “Our routine checks do cover these things, but they are not done every day, they are done six-monthly or annually.”

He acknowledged that as  a system ages, the frequency of checks needs to rise, adding SMRT is putting in place “conditioning monitoring systems” that will help it do this. However, it takes time to implement this.

Mr Kuek said the operator will not be able to catch every potential fault even if it stepped up maintenance. ""So one solution is to completely renew the system,"" he said. Another would be to put in place condition monitoring systems. Mr Kuek said SMRT was doing all it could to make the network more reliable, but priority had to be given to the third rail, sleepers and signalling system.

“To bring higher rail reliability there will be road bumps,” he added.

SMRT and the Land Transport Authority held a joint press conference on Wednesday morning. Both SMRT chief executive Desmond Kuek and LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong apologised for the disruption, which affected over 250,000 commuters. 

'We would like to apologise to commuters and all who were inconvenienced by the ??MRT disruptions,"" said SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek at the press conference. In response to the service breakdown, Chew Men Leong, LTA chief executive, also apologized for the incident and claimed that they need some time to investigate the incident due to the massive system. 

He added that the SMRT engineers have worked overnight to find out the root cause of the power trip.

SMRT Corp has identified three possible causes of Tuesday's unprecedented breakdown on the North-South and East-West lines: worn cable insulation, tunnel water leakage, and a glitch in a power substation. It pointed to these possible causes at a media conference yesterday but said it was ""not 100 per cent sure"" that they led to the breakdown, and that it was continuing investigations to determine if there are other causes. 

Asked if these potential flaws would have been picked up during routine checks, SMRT Trains managing director Lee Ling Wee said : “Our routine checks do cover these things, but they are not done every day, they are done six-monthly or annually.”

He acknowledged that as  a system ages, the frequency of checks needs to rise, adding SMRT is putting in place “conditioning monitoring systems” that will help it do this. However, it takes time to implement this.

Mr Kuek said the operator will not be able to catch every potential fault even if it stepped up maintenance. ""So one solution is to completely renew the system,"" he said. Another would be to put in place condition monitoring systems. Mr Kuek said SMRT was doing all it could to make the network more reliable, but priority had to be given to the third rail, sleepers and signalling system.

“To bring higher rail reliability there will be road bumps,” he added.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"These were the post-incident press coverage on Wednesday, 8 July.


Hours after the North-South and East-West lines were hit simultaneously by an unprecedented breakdown yesterday (July 7), services resumed this morning — at a reduced speed initially — and the trains ran smoothly throughout the day, as commuters went about their daily routines without any fuss.

Following the breakdown, SMRT had advised commuters to make alternative travelling plans the next day, as the affected lines may experience limited service.

Some had left for work about an hour earlier in the morning, for fear that they might be caught in another train breakdown, following Singapore's worst service disruptions on Tuesday evening.

Operator SMRT Corp had planned to shut down train services on the North- South Line between 11am and 4pm yesterday , to conduct further investigations into the causes of the power trips. But it opted not to after there were no power trips in the morning said the Land Transport Authority. There were no power trips during the evening peak periods either, as trains ran smoothly.
 
When The Straits Times visited five stations on the two affected lines, such as Bishan, Tampines and Raffles Place, yesterday between 7am and 11am, trains came every two to six minutes.

Commuters said they checked the news or social media for updates on the situation before setting off on their journeys. In contrast to the frustrations shown by many commuters last night, those whom TODAY spoke to were in a more forgiving mood over the massive breakdown.

UniSIM transport expert Park Byung Joon noted that the scale of the breakdown was unprecedented and that a normal contingency could not have handled it.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"These were the press coverage of PM Lee Hsien Loong’s Facebook post on Wednesday evening, 8 July.


While an overnight sweep of the North-South and East-West lines turned up several faults including damaged power cables and water leakage, the authorities and train operator SMRT were still none the wiser about the root cause of yesterday’s (July 7) unprecedented breakdown — prompting Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to express his concern that the problem, which brought the two lines to a complete halt and left about 250,000 commuters stranded across the island, could flare up again. 

Mr Lee noted that Land Transport Authority and SMRT staff worked overnight to check the trains, tracks and cables and the trains resumed full service throughout today without a glitch. “But because we have not identified the root cause of the power trips, we are still very worried that the problem may recur,” Mr Lee wrote on Facebook.

While an overnight sweep of the North-South and East-West lines turned up several faults including damaged power cables and water leakage, the authorities and train operator SMRT were still none the wiser about the root cause of yesterday’s (July 7) unprecedented breakdown — prompting Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to express his concern that the problem, which brought the two lines to a complete halt and left about 250,000 commuters stranded across the island, could flare up again. 

Mr Lee noted that Land Transport Authority and SMRT staff worked overnight to check the trains, tracks and cables and the trains resumed full service throughout today without a glitch. “But because we have not identified the root cause of the power trips, we are still very worried that the problem may recur,” Mr Lee wrote on Facebook.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"These were the press coverage of Transport Minister’s doorstop interview with media done early morning, Wednesday 8 July.

Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said it will likely take a few days for investigations into Tuesday night's train disruptions to the North-South and East-West Lines to be completed. 

Mr Lui added he was at the operations centre at the Land Transport Authority at 6am to get an update on what happened overnight, before subsequently taking the train to Ang Mo Kio MRT station. 

He noted that SMRT has done visual checks on the entire fleet of trains. Checks on the electrical resistance in trains were also conducted as a suspected electrical issue may have caused the disruption.

Forum,,,"These were the forum letters and commentary pieces that arose from the latest rail disruption.

Forum letters
Despite the astounding massive train breakdown, reader, Tan E-Ping, claimed that recovery on the part of SMRT leaves much to be desired even after so many incidents. She also highlighted various poor services from the SMRT during train breakdown such as half-heartedly employee giving out fliers; poor crowd control; and lack of information on free buses. She stated that commuters have the right to expect better contingency plans being more effectively put in place, and hopes the Land Transport Authority will look into this before the damage to our nation's reputation, as an efficient First World nation, becomes irreparable.

Reader Will Woong Kwok Siong points out that while commuters have come to accept train delays nowadays, what has been learnt from past experiences to avoid such an occurrence as Tuesday’s train disruption? (“Minister calls for probe into cause of train disruption”; July 8). Reader pointed out some of the commuter feedback on the breakdown, such as not knowing where to look for the free bus services, as well as MRT staff ill-equipped to advise commuters, are not isolated issues and have been highlighted in the past. Reader also pointed out on the lack of clear signs and directions again, and suggested that the communication between the train operators and among various stations can be better managed within the transport network, so that commuters can be kept informed and make alternative plans.

Reader, Jane Chan, claimed that the disruption of train services on Tuesday cost time and money. She shared the chaotic state at Jurong East MRT station, where commuters alighted at an unfamiliar places. She suggested for bigger signs to show the destinations of the buses or offer bus services that follow the destination of the train routes.

Reader, Choy Kah Wai, claimed that given the train operator's breakdown record the massive breakdown on Tuesday, it is high time chief executives and other senior management of train operators be made accountable for train service performance, and not just profit. Although SMRT is a private company, he said it still has a public service role to fulfill. Moreover, he believes SMRT should also be made answerable to the public and not just shareholders.

Reader, Leslie Sun Zihao, claimed that there needs to be clear policies on how commuters are to be compensated for the inconvenience caused to them when trains break down.

Writer Yoong Siew Wah voices his dissatisfaction with SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek in this inline opinion piece. He urges PM Lee and Minister Lui Tuck Yew to see the shortcomings of Mr Kuek, stating that with the frequent MRT disruptions, the SMRT CEO does not deserve a bonus.  He states that the nationalization of the transport system could be the panacea of transport ills.

Writer, Zhou Zihui, shared her experience as a commuter affected by the massive MRT service breakdown yesterday. She claimed that the sense of helplessness and impatience are valid as service faults still are still occurring despite SMRT's promises. Despite the various plans announced to improve local transport services, the reader stated that common folks like herself are more interested with daily commuting issues rather than understanding the details of those large development projects introduced by local train operators.

Commentaries and editorials
Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan, shared that the recent massive MRT line breakdown was a result of fairly commonplace weaknesses - worn cable insulation, tunnel water leakage, and a glitch in a power substation switch. He argued that it had nothing to do with the major assets being replaced. He states that such service disruptions are still fairly frequent and the reasons cited above have actually figured prominently in past incidences. As such they cannot be categorized as unknown weaknesses. Mr Tan is of the opinion that apologies from the operator, regulator or Government are beginning to sound glib and hollow. He believes that the Government should step in to help beef up resources required for SMRT to make things right quickly.

Associate law professor with Singapore Management University Eugene Tan said the train disruption on Tuesday once again reminds us that we still have some ways to go in ensuring the reliability and resilience of our train network. While he acknowledges SMRT and the related authorities' efforts over the past 4 years, affected passengers are more concerned about the results than their efforts. The fire at Bukit Panjang LRT system early this year and the major disruption on Tuesday highlights a string of problems plaguing SMRT, causing inconvenience to passengers and affecting their confidence in the public transport system. Many affected passengers also expressed their dissatisfaction over how SMRT handled the disruption, but perhaps passengers should also have better response ability and explore other methods in getting to their destination.

With two main train lines down and long queues for buses on Tuesday night, many commuters looked for other ways home and turned to taxis and taxi apps such as Uber. Trans-Cab general manager Jasmine Tan said the company informed all its drivers at about 7.30pm, shortly after the Land Transport Authority put out an alert that train services on the North-South and East-West lines were disrupted. Commuters also turned to taxi apps such as Uber, which had ""thousands of drivers"" on the roads, said an Uber spokesman. However, Uber, which imposes a surcharge when demand peaks, received some flak yesterday after some commuters were charged as much as five times the normal fare.

A LHZB editorial piece refers to the major disruption on North South Line and East West Line on July 7 and highlighted that Singaporeans should solve the issues at its roots instead of helplessly accepting train disruptions as a normal occurrence. The incident also highlights the issues with the reliability and safety of the train system in Singapore as well as the train operator's inability to implement remedial measures smoothly even though it is not the first time train disruptions have occurred. Despite the many issues, the writer concluded that this incident has provided an opportunity for reflection to further improve public transport services.

However, Uber, which imposes a surcharge when demand peaks, received some flak yesterday after some commuters were charged as much as five times the normal fare.

A LHZB editorial piece refers to the major disruption on North South Line and East West Line on July 7 and highlighted that Singaporeans should solve the issues at its roots instead of helplessly accepting train disruptions as a normal occurrence. The incident also highlights the issues with the reliability and safety of the train system in Singapore as well as the train operator's inability to implement remedial measures smoothly even though it is not the first time train disruptions have occurred. Despite the many issues, the writer concluded that this incident has provided an opportunity for reflection to further improve public transport services.

Forum letters
Despite the astounding massive train breakdown, reader, Tan E-Ping, claimed that recovery on the part of SMRT leaves much to be desired even after so many incidents. She also highlighted various poor services from the SMRT during train breakdown such as half-heartedly employee giving out fliers; poor crowd control; and lack of information on free buses. She stated that commuters have the right to expect better contingency plans being more effectively put in place, and hopes the Land Transport Authority will look into this before the damage to our nation's reputation, as an efficient First World nation, becomes irreparable.

Reader Will Woong Kwok Siong points out that while commuters have come to accept train delays nowadays, what has been learnt from past experiences to avoid such an occurrence as Tuesday’s train disruption? (“Minister calls for probe into cause of train disruption”; July 8). Reader pointed out some of the commuter feedback on the breakdown, such as not knowing where to look for the free bus services, as well as MRT staff ill-equipped to advise commuters, are not isolated issues and have been highlighted in the past. Reader also pointed out on the lack of clear signs and directions again, and suggested that the communication between the train operators and among various stations can be better managed within the transport network, so that commuters can be kept informed and make alternative plans.

Reader, Jane Chan, claimed that the disruption of train services on Tuesday cost time and money. She shared the chaotic state at Jurong East MRT station, where commuters alighted at an unfamiliar places. She suggested for bigger signs to show the destinations of the buses or offer bus services that follow the destination of the train routes.

Reader, Choy Kah Wai, claimed that given the train operator's breakdown record the massive breakdown on Tuesday, it is high time chief executives and other senior management of train operators be made accountable for train service performance, and not just profit. Although SMRT is a private company, he said it still has a public service role to fulfill. Moreover, he believes SMRT should also be made answerable to the public and not just shareholders.

Reader, Leslie Sun Zihao, claimed that there needs to be clear policies on how commuters are to be compensated for the inconvenience caused to them when trains break down.

Writer Yoong Siew Wah voices his dissatisfaction with SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek in this inline opinion piece. He urges PM Lee and Minister Lui Tuck Yew to see the shortcomings of Mr Kuek, stating that with the frequent MRT disruptions, the SMRT CEO does not deserve a bonus.  He states that the nationalization of the transport system could be the panacea of transport ills.

Writer, Zhou Zihui, shared her experience as a commuter affected by the massive MRT service breakdown yesterday. She claimed that the sense of helplessness and impatience are valid as service faults still are still occurring despite SMRT's promises. Despite the various plans announced to improve local transport services, the reader stated that common folks like herself are more interested with daily commuting issues rather than understanding the details of those large development projects introduced by local train operators.

Commentaries and editorials
Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan, shared that the recent massive MRT line breakdown was a result of fairly commonplace weaknesses - worn cable insulation, tunnel water leakage, and a glitch in a power substation switch. He argued that it had nothing to do with the major assets being replaced. He states that such service disruptions are still fairly frequent and the reasons cited above have actually figured prominently in past incidences. As such they cannot be categorized as unknown weaknesses. Mr Tan is of the opinion that apologies from the operator, regulator or Government are beginning to sound glib and hollow. He believes that the Government should step in to help beef up resources required for SMRT to make things right quickly.

Associate law professor with Singapore Management University Eugene Tan said the train disruption on Tuesday once again reminds us that we still have some ways to go in ensuring the reliability and resilience of our train network. While he acknowledges SMRT and the related authorities' efforts over the past 4 years, affected passengers are more concerned about the results than their efforts. The fire at Bukit Panjang LRT system early this year and the major disruption on Tuesday highlights a string of problems plaguing SMRT, causing inconvenience to passengers and affecting their confidence in the public transport system. Many affected passengers also expressed their dissatisfaction over how SMRT handled the disruption, but perhaps passengers should also have better response ability and explore other methods in getting to their destination.

With two main train lines down and long queues for buses on Tuesday night, many commuters looked for other ways home and turned to taxis and taxi apps such as Uber. Trans-Cab general manager Jasmine Tan said the company informed all its drivers at about 7.30pm, shortly after the Land Transport Authority put out an alert that train services on the North-South and East-West lines were disrupted.

She suggested for bigger signs to show the destinations of the buses or offer bus services that follow the destination of the train routes.

Reader, Choy Kah Wai, claimed that given the train operator's breakdown record the massive breakdown on Tuesday, it is high time chief executives and other senior management of train operators be made accountable for train service performance, and not just profit. Although SMRT is a private company, he said it still has a public service role to fulfill. Moreover, he believes SMRT should also be made answerable to the public and not just shareholders.

Reader, Leslie Sun Zihao, claimed that there needs to be clear policies on how commuters are to be compensated for the inconvenience caused to them when trains break down.

Writer Yoong Siew Wah voices his dissatisfaction with SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek in this inline opinion piece. He urges PM Lee and Minister Lui Tuck Yew to see the shortcomings of Mr Kuek, stating that with the frequent MRT disruptions, the SMRT CEO does not deserve a bonus.  He states that the nationalization of the transport system could be the panacea of transport ills.

Writer, Zhou Zihui, shared her experience as a commuter affected by the massive MRT service breakdown yesterday. She claimed that the sense of helplessness and impatience are valid as service faults still are still occurring despite SMRT's promises. Despite the various plans announced to improve local transport services, the reader stated that common folks like herself are more interested with daily commuting issues rather than understanding the details of those large development projects introduced by local train operators.

Commentaries and editorials
Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan, shared that the recent massive MRT line breakdown was a result of fairly commonplace weaknesses - worn cable insulation, tunnel water leakage, and a glitch in a power substation switch. He argued that it had nothing to do with the major assets being replaced. He states that such service disruptions are still fairly frequent and the reasons cited above have actually figured prominently in past incidences. As such they cannot be categorized as unknown weaknesses. Mr Tan is of the opinion that apologies from the operator, regulator or Government are beginning to sound glib and hollow. He believes that the Government should step in to help beef up resources required for SMRT to make things right quickly.

Associate law professor with Singapore Management University Eugene Tan said the train disruption on Tuesday once again reminds us that we still have some ways to go in ensuring the reliability and resilience of our train network. While he acknowledges SMRT and the related authorities' efforts over the past 4 years, affected passengers are more concerned about the results than their efforts. The fire at Bukit Panjang LRT system early this year and the major disruption on Tuesday highlights a string of problems plaguing SMRT, causing inconvenience to passengers and affecting their confidence in the public transport system. Many affected passengers also expressed their dissatisfaction over how SMRT handled the disruption, but perhaps passengers should also have better response ability and explore other methods in getting to their destination.

With two main train lines down and long queues for buses on Tuesday night, many commuters looked for other ways home and turned to taxis and taxi apps such as Uber. Trans-Cab general manager Jasmine Tan said the company informed all its drivers at about 7.30pm, shortly after the Land Transport Authority put out an alert that train services on the North-South and East-West lines were disrupted. Commuters also turned to taxi apps such as Uber, which had ""thousands of drivers"" on the roads, said an Uber spokesman. However, Uber, which imposes a surcharge when demand peaks, received some flak yesterday after some commuters were charged as much as five times the normal fare.

A LHZB editorial piece refers to the major disruption on North South Line and East West Line on July 7 and highlighted that Singaporeans should solve the issues at its roots instead of helplessly accepting train disruptions as a normal occurrence. The incident also highlights the issues with the reliability and safety of the train system in Singapore as well as the train operator's inability to implement remedial measures smoothly even though it is not the first time train disruptions have occurred. Despite the many issues, the writer concluded that this incident has provided an opportunity for reflection to further improve public transport services.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"The front page feature in the Shi Min Daily of the SMRT breakdown which occurred on Tuesday covers a whole range of stories, which include:

•         President and Group CEO Desmond Kuek said SMRT has improved rail reliability over the past few years but there will also be new problems from the introduced trains and ageing MRT system. He indicated that there is no 100% way to find the potential faults even if maintenance works were strengthened.

•         One netizen pointed out that no one is expecting SMRT to find and rectify all problems, however when a problem  arises, the rail company should identify the problem and fix it .

•         SMRT verifying that the track fault which occurred on Friday was not a precursor to the events on Tuesday. Last Friday, thousands of commuters were affected after a track circuit fault caused trains to slow down and stall intermittently on the North- South Line for two hours during the morning rush. SMRT Trains managing director Lee Ling Wee verified that last Friday’s track fault was due to a signaling fault and this had nothing to do with power outages.

•         An interview with National University of Singapore transport researcher Lee Der Horng , who said that the way buses were deployed as part of contingency services could have been improved. He suggested that the buses activated operated in similar ways as the trains and should only stop sat stations.

•         A story about a kind Samaritan who gave rides to three stranded people with his private car.

•         The activation of 119 additonal buses by SMRT during the breakdown.

•         Transport expert Lee Der Horng shedding light on why increasing taxi services amidst train breakdowns might do more harm than good.  He states that in such times, the main priority is to ferry huge numbers of commuters to another location. Taxis have limited space and an increase in the number of taxis could lead to congestions, this defeats the purpose of a contingency plan.

•         A short reflection by journalists who highlighted that SMRT’s contingency plans had improved since the 2011 December breakdowns. The free travel, quick information dissemination and handling of complaints were praised.

•         An interview with a psychologist on why commuters were not in panic mode was also featured. The psychologist says that commuters were calm as they were used to breakdowns and they also had forms of communication to remain in contact with their loved ones and friends.

•         The last panel features a statement by the Workers’ Party calling for an increase in frequency of maintenance scheduling by SMRT.

•         In response to the massive MRT service disruption at East West and North South Line on Tuesday, the members of public hopes the authorities could quickly find the cause of the train fault and rectify it as they worry that a similar incident might happen again and causing inconvenience to commuters. SMRT has identified three possible causes of Tuesday's unprecedented breakdown on the North-South and East-West lines: worn cable insulation at Bishan station, tunnel water leakage at Tanjong Pagar station, and a glitch in a power substation at Kranji station. However, the authorities have yet to pinpoint a cause that led to the incident.

•         A story on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong being briefed at the LTA Operations Centre. The article highlighted that he was worried about the breakdown of the two rail lines as the root cause of the problem has not been identified yet.

•         Information on passenger refunds was also featured. Despite the fact that travel was free from the breakdown till 12 noon the next day. While some stations opened their fare gates for commuters to exit, other stations still required for commuters to exit via the normal way of tapping their cards. A fare refund sign was hung at the Passenger Service Stations, stating that passengers could get a fare refund from the Passenger Service Centre “if your journey was interrupted by a service disruption on the North South, East West, Circle Line or Bukit Panjang LRT”. Passengers affected collect their refunds within the next 14 days.

•         An interview with National University of Singapore transport expert, Lee Der Horng was also conducted where he suggested that the power supply for the two lines be separated. This way when one fails, the other line will not be affected.

•         An interview with Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies Dr Gillian Koh was also featured. In her interview, she said that it was a pity that such an incident occurred. Efforts to build up commuter trust have all gone down the drain with such a mishap.

•         Concerns by the workers party were also featured, whereby the called for an increase in frequency of maintenance checks.

•         SMRT shares slipped four cents to S$1.505, following a train disruption that involved two major train lines on Tuesday.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"Train services on the Circle Line was disrupted yesterday evening at about 6pm. Members of the public said that they waited 40 mins to board CCL trains today. Long queues were seen at Tai Seng MRT, and to prevent overcrowding, SMRT prohibited passengers from entering the station. Wanbao mentioned that no announcements were made by SMRT via their social media channels regarding this disruption."
SMRT Trains,CSR,Positive ,"This is the second episode of the “City on the Move”.

The MRT has been around close to 30 years. Denise Keller pointed out that train commute has been a integral part of our life. Close to 3 million people using it to get work, school, play and home daily. The MRT is truly the heart of Singapore’s busy transport system. The aim is to get more people to choose public transport. Right now 66 per cent of rush hour travel happens on MRT and buses. But the Land Transport Authority want this to hit 75 per cent by the year 2030. Denise Keller pointed out with that, the MRT should grow bigger and better, which is exactly happening right now.

By 2030, Singapore will have 3 brand new MRT lines as well as 4 extensions to the existing system, which means that 80 percent of Singapore households will be no more than 10 minute walk from a station. Interviewing some commuters, they feel that the whole network in Singapore is not complete, and they could not reach to certain places. Another commuter pointed out that It takes long time to get to the middle using the Red Line near UTI. Denise Keller questioned if Singapore’s MRT match up with Hong Kong MTR and brought us to Hong Kong to find out.

Hong Kong packed to the brim with shopping, eating and people. It has population density of around 6.5 thousand people per sq/km. That’s about a thousand less than Singapore, but the city is perpetually grounded on the ground level and under. Denise Keller, in Hong Kong pointed out the rush hour at 9am in Admiralty Station. This station is a transfer station between Kowloon Island and Hong Kong island and it is a busy station. The system is one of the busiest in the world. Their 8 main lines and more than 80 stations dotting the island, but 8 lines still not enough for the 5.3 million passengers that ferries around daily. That is because a recent increase in ridership.

Prof Hung Wing-Tat from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University pointed out that the population due to immigrants by giving example of that 150 people from Mainland China immigrate to Hong Kong everyday, which equates to half a million people. The city transport planners and real operators of MTR had long anticipated an increase demand of train services. So it is working on a strategy to ramp up its capacity that means building more lines across the city. The have started building 5 new lines already with another 4 coming by the year 2026. Every new train station in Hong Kong comes with the host of retail, commercial and sometimes residential options built in, with that it creates new opportunity in the process. And that is exactly what is going on in Singapore as well. Now train stations are like mini malls of their own, which we can shop and eat there, and also time to appreciate the culture. SMRT’s Raffles Xchange and Esplanade Xchange was featured.  Salleh Japar, Senior Lecturer, LASALLE College of the Arts was commissioned to do art installation in Paya Lebar station under the LTA’s Art and Transit Programme. 

Hong Kong too is in the act of injecting some art and culture into their stations. Every Friday night, Art and Culture Underground, the way Hong Kong’s MTR does it. Started in 2004, this stage has a been a launching pad for various local performing group. It’s all part of the MTR Living Art Programme. Tim Nga points out that something similar taking shape in Singapore as well. The Land Transport Authority wants to liven things up in the trains station and they roped in buskers to perform while commuters wait for the train. And by the looks of it, its definitely music to their ears. Tim Nga meet The Uplines, whom are music students from School of the Arts decided one day to perform and make small change. Commuters commented that the music is relaxing and creates nice atmosphere. Another commuter pointed it’s not bad but there is no time to enjoy as they have to catch a train.

Denise and Tim Nga tested both Singapore and Hong Kong rides. They will travel similar distance for about 15 kilometres across the city, setting off at the same time 10.30am from the heartlands to the centre of town. Denise Keller starts in Kowloon Bay and her mission is to get to City Centre in Hong Kong Island, with 13 stops and 1 transit. Meanwhile in Singapore, Tim Nga starts in Clementi Station to reach Orchard Station, also with 13 stops.

Denise Keller noticed that the MTR train speed is slightly faster than the Singapore’s train and the train stops in between is 1 minute. Denise reached in 28 minutes to the Central, whilst Tim Nga reached in 25 minutes time. Tim Nga pointed out the ride was comfortable and the view was really nice along the EWL and he got a seat later on the ride. Whilst, Denise Keller pointed out the MTR was really crowded and city like Hong Kong, they have to get used to crowds.

MRT system will expand because we are getting 99 brand new rides which means increased passenger capacity as well as bringing down waiting time to no more than 5 minutes during off peak period. Tim Nga is at site Thomson East Coast Line, Orchard Station pointed out that it may not look as much now, but within these walls and beneath his feet, lies marvels of modern engineering.  Mr. Ng Kee Nam, Deputy Group Director Rail (Civil), Land Transport Authority involved in construction of MRT stations since our real systems was born and he understands every process. One of the most demanding task is building dire frame walls. He pointed out that involves 24 hours and 7 days a week to ensure the concrete has uniformed quality throughput the lengths. Each panel of the dire frame wall takes about 3 to 5 days to complete and a total of 150 panels to install on the site, the workers will be working non-stop within one and a half years.
Tim Nga questioned whether residents complained on the noise. Mr Ng Kee Nam explained this process involves heavy machineries construction, and noise is unavoidable and he believes it is an understanding of the stakeholders living surrounding to allow them to finish the construction soonest possible.

Denise Keller dwells into Free Station WIFI. Christopher Hooi, Infocomm and Technology team with LTA, the mastermind of this very useful amenity. He said this helps commuters to stay in contact through Social Media, send messages, download games and so on as waiting time can be well spent. The WIFI also helps to monitor how crowded the station is at a particular point in time and that is what Chris was studying..

The MRT is a catalyst for opening up  new frontiers and fresh opportunities. The expansion of this sprawling network in the years and decades to come brings promise a bold new feature moving forward. The next episode will be about buses.

Commentary by LHZB correspondent Lee Ching Yee on MRT breakdown. Instead of a reactionary approach to deal with problems only when they arise, the transportation authorities should find out the underlying problem and treat it instead of piecemeal, reactive solutions that only treat the symptoms. Separately, the Workers' Party said that the government should maintain the transportation network more seriously. Ching Yee mentioned that nobody, including LTA and SMRT hoped for a disruption and that they have spent considerable resources into involving the reliability of the system but questioned if the aging system has a fundamental problem with the design.

A Business Times editorial post claimed that Singapore's largest public transport breakdown to date - a power trip that crippled services on two major MRT lines on Tuesday - has resurfaced commuters' doubts and frustration over rail reliability. Moreover, it also raises questions over SMRT Corporation's proposed move to a new rail financing framework, which has been in discussion for over a year now. This unprecedented disruption will worsen already tainted perceptions of rail reliability - which the government says has actually improved.

BT writer, Joyce Hooi, claimed that Singapore has had to grapple with not being first in train services, at the very least, after two major train breakdowns here, and the many other service mishaps in between. She believed the lowered expectations of Singaporeans towards local train service has partially explained how the response to the Worst Train Breakdown of 2015 appeared leavened by gallows humour and acts of selflessness.

Forum letters
Reader, Christopher Tang Wei Ling, suggest that the current maintenance programme to be overhauled. He urged not to continue the implementation of breakdown maintenance or rely on old predictive models to initiate replacement. Therefore, new models have to be developed, and a proactive programme to replace hardware that was installed decades ago needs to be executed.

Reader, Wong Shih Shen, suggested for Singapore MRT operators to learn from Hong Kong's MTR due to the recent major disruption at local train networks. CNN recently ran a report on the Hong Kong MTR and branded it as what success looks like from a rail operator's perspective. For example, with two operators, SMRT and SBS Transit, perhaps Singapore needs a centralised control centre to manage the whole rail network

Reader, Ronald Paul Ng, suggested to have the money collected from train operators used to compensate commuters. He claimed that the amount collected from fines could be divided by the number of travel cards the public hold, and credit the same amount to each card.

SMRT Corporate,Financials,Negative,"DBS Group Research expect the occurrence of the latest train disruption, which appears to be the most major one since December 2011, to pose downside risks to our cost assumptions. The closing price for SMRT on July 9 was S$1.485, while the target price by DBS Group Research was S$1.59."
SMRT Buses,Service Announcements,Positive ,"With a route winding through both housing and industrial estates in Woodlands, feeder bus service 964 is often packed with residents and workers during the morning and evening rush hours. Service 964, operated by SMRT, is one of the latest services to have been augmented under the Government's billion-dollar Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP). Under the initiative, the Government partnered operators to enhance bus capacity and boost service levels, to address the issues of rising public transport ridership."

•      Following Tuesday night's MRT breakdown, the public have called for the transportation authorities here to learn from the Hong Kong system.
•      Transport expert Prof Lee Der-Horng commented that Singapore lacks sufficient trained engineers to cope with the situation and LTA should expand alternative modes of transport and not solely rely on rail
•      He commented that future lines should be equipped with spare tracks and redundancies despite the cost
•      Circle Line experienced a disruption at about 6pm on Thursday night. Passengers commented that station staff said that they were unsure what was happening when being questioned.
•      President and Group CEO Desmond Kuek was spotted on a routine inspection visit on board a train along the NSL.

Editorials/Commentaries
An editorial by Wanbao’s sub editor Chen Kaisong. He said that the recent SMRT breakdown had caused a loss in confidence in the MRT system here. Once a gold standard for public transportation, the standard had dropped. He met an old friend recently who just returned from a trip in Taiwan. His friend commented on the Taiwan's metro system and concluded that its service was better than Singapore's. His friend saw how a train staff swiftly helped an elderly get on to the platform and then into a train with good spirit and sincerity.  The Taipei metro is also fitted with stickers and friendly reminders of safety for its passengers. He hopes that instead of just apologizing each time a disruption occurs, SMRT should reduce the occurrences of such incidents.
 
Editor of Zaobao wrote that SMRT has failed to find the cause of the major train service disruption recently despite two rounds of inspections. Hence, LTA has to set up an independent consultant group to help diagnose the problem. Although the cause is likely to be found later, the incident highlighted the lack of skills on SMRT's maintenance crews and the urgent need for SMRT to strengthen them for the future.
 
Forum letters
Dr. William Wan, General Secretary, Singapore Kindness Movement pointed out that during the massive MRT breakdown on Tuesday, it was heartening to hear that amid the chaos, unhappiness and negativity, there was a swell of compassion and kindness (""Making good out of a bad situation"" by Ms Susan Tan Chwee Huay, ""Kind acts lift spirits amid all the disruption""; both published on Thursday, and ""Kind acts, a poem and song lyrics, amid MRT breakdown chaos"" ; ST Online, Wednesday). Dr. William pointed out by cooperating and working together, whether by helping drivers pass instructions down the bus, ride-sharing, shepherding traffic or buying drinks and snacks for SMRT and Land Transport Authority ground staff, these commuters make us feel good and, in turn, inspire others to feel better. While Singaporeans can rightly seek accountability for the fiasco, they should not let it overwhelm their better nature.
 
Reader, Zheng Zaisheng, highlighted that SMRT is closely linked to national public transport system and the people. Hence, it must use practical technology team as its core and not overemphasize on cost savings. He claimed that SMRT has to build a reliable operational system in the long run and should groom young employees into practical talents through overseas attachments and systematic trainings. He believes that SMRT will eventually achieve that and he hopes that opinion makers should make constructive remarks as the technical issues are complicated and cannot be resolved easily.
 
In an open letter to Singaporeans thanking Singapore for 50 years of achievements, Kishore Mahbbubani pointed out despite the massive MRT breakdown on Tuesday, our MRT system has improved. Though far from reaching First World Swiss standards.
 
Reader Darius Foo opined that the spillover effects of train breakdowns would be felt by drivers as commuters now rely on the roads to get home. This puts added strain and stress on drivers in having to cope with more congested roads. SMRT's ability to provide excellent transport service ultimately affects the ability of the entire transport ecosystem within Singapore to function efficiently, he added.
 
Reader Yeo Thye Lye pointed out while the focus is now on finding out what caused Tuesday's unprecedented breakdown of both the East-West and North-South lines (""Independent expert to look into rail network""; Friday), SMRT should also examine why were the efforts to deal with the fallout of the breakdown still not up to mark, despite the experience with previous breakdowns. Reader also questioned why was so little attention paid to ensuring contingency plans would be well executed. He pointed out as a private organisation, SMRT would strive to maximise resources and would not have buses just lying idle, waiting to be deployed in the event of a train disruption. The same would go for SBS Transit. Mr Yeo suggested one solution is to tap private buses and wondered if any were deployed on Tuesday night. Many of them would have been available at that time of night. Finally, he pointed out there needs to be more effort and focus on contingency plans, in addition to ensuring breakdowns are kept to a minimum.
 
Reader James Chew pointed out despite free bus services were made available at all stations on the two MRT lines hit by the service disruption on Tuesday many commuters, especially children found it difficult to continue their journey. Hesuggested that it is time to establish some sort of etiquette in boarding the buses. Mr Chew pointed out that women and children should be allowed to board first, followed by the aged and the infirm. Able-bodied men should be at the back of the queue. Posters explaining this in the four local languages should be displayed at bus stops and on buses. Reader also suggested that during emergencies bus drivers and marshals should be able to direct commuters to follow this rule, as this will help to ensure that our children will not have to walk home in such situations.
 
Reader Zee Kok Eng questioned have we become complacent with the standard operating procedures, especially of our maintenance programmes. He pointed out since ours is an ageing system, we should be more vigilant and perhaps even paranoid about improving our maintenance programmes, so as to eliminate random or freak breakdowns. He drew comparisons with our train systems with that found in Tokyo.
 
In the light of the latest train breakdown, the Government needs to rethink its belief that the privatisation of key infrastructure would give better service, efficiency and cost savings, said reader John Ng Tian Siong. The problem with privatisation is that the bottom line is a key concern, and corners will be cut to maintain profitability, as any private organisation would do, he added.

Editor of Zaobao wrote that SMRT has failed to find the cause of the major train service disruption recently despite two rounds of inspections. Hence, LTA has to set up an independent consultant group to help diagnose the problem. Although the cause is likely to be found later, the incident highlighted the lack of skills on SMRT's maintenance crews and the urgent need for SMRT to strengthen them for the future.
 
Forum letters
Dr. William Wan, General Secretary, Singapore Kindness Movement pointed out that during the massive MRT breakdown on Tuesday, it was heartening to hear that amid the chaos, unhappiness and negativity, there was a swell of compassion and kindness (""Making good out of a bad situation"" by Ms Susan Tan Chwee Huay, ""Kind acts lift spirits amid all the disruption""; both published on Thursday, and ""Kind acts, a poem and song lyrics, amid MRT breakdown chaos"" ; ST Online, Wednesday). Dr. William pointed out by cooperating and working together, whether by helping drivers pass instructions down the bus, ride-sharing, shepherding traffic or buying drinks and snacks for SMRT and Land Transport Authority ground staff, these commuters make us feel good and, in turn, inspire others to feel better. While Singaporeans can rightly seek accountability for the fiasco, they should not let it overwhelm their better nature.
 
Reader, Zheng Zaisheng, highlighted that SMRT is closely linked to national public transport system and the people. Hence, it must use practical technology team as its core and not overemphasize on cost savings. He claimed that SMRT has to build a reliable operational system in the long run and should groom young employees into practical talents through overseas attachments and systematic trainings. He believes that SMRT will eventually achieve that and he hopes that opinion makers should make constructive remarks as the technical issues are complicated and cannot be resolved easily.
 
In an open letter to Singaporeans thanking Singapore for 50 years of achievements, Kishore Mahbbubani pointed out despite the massive MRT breakdown on Tuesday, our MRT system has improved. Though far from reaching First World Swiss standards.
 
Reader Darius Foo opined that the spillover effects of train breakdowns would be felt by drivers as commuters now rely on the roads to get home. This puts added strain and stress on drivers in having to cope with more congested roads. SMRT's ability to provide excellent transport service ultimately affects the ability of the entire transport ecosystem within Singapore to function efficiently, he added.
 
Reader Yeo Thye Lye pointed out while the focus is now on finding out what caused Tuesday's unprecedented breakdown of both the East-West and North-South lines (""Independent expert to look into rail network""; Friday), SMRT should also examine why were the efforts to deal with the fallout of the breakdown still not up to mark, despite the experience with previous breakdowns. Reader also questioned why was so little attention paid to ensuring contingency plans would be well executed. He pointed out as a private organisation, SMRT would strive to maximise resources and would not have buses just lying idle, waiting to be deployed in the event of a train disruption. The same would go for SBS Transit. Mr Yeo suggested one solution is to tap private buses and wondered if any were deployed on Tuesday night. Many of them would have been available at that time of night. Finally, he pointed out there needs to be more effort and focus on contingency plans, in addition to ensuring breakdowns are kept to a minimum.
 
Reader James Chew pointed out despite free bus services were made available at all stations on the two MRT lines hit by the service disruption on Tuesday many commuters, especially children found it difficult to continue their journey. Hesuggested that it is time to establish some sort of etiquette in boarding the buses. Mr Chew pointed out that women and children should be allowed to board first, followed by the aged and the infirm. Able-bodied men should be at the back of the queue. Posters explaining this in the four local languages should be displayed at bus stops and on buses. Reader also suggested that during emergencies bus drivers and marshals should be able to direct commuters to follow this rule, as this will help to ensure that our children will not have to walk home in such situations.
 
Reader Zee Kok Eng questioned have we become complacent with the standard operating procedures, especially of our maintenance programmes. He pointed out since ours is an ageing system, we should be more vigilant and perhaps even paranoid about improving our maintenance programmes, so as to eliminate random or freak breakdowns. He drew comparisons with our train systems with that found in Tokyo.
 
In the light of the latest train breakdown, the Government needs to rethink its belief that the privatisation of key infrastructure would give better service, efficiency and cost savings, said reader John Ng Tian Siong. The problem with privatisation is that the bottom line is a key concern, and corners will be cut to maintain profitability, as any private organisation would do, he added.

Editorials/Commentaries
An editorial by Wanbao’s sub editor Chen Kaisong. He said that the recent SMRT breakdown had caused a loss in confidence in the MRT system here. Once a gold standard for public transportation, the standard had dropped. He met an old friend recently who just returned from a trip in Taiwan. His friend commented on the Taiwan's metro system and concluded that its service was better than Singapore's. His friend saw how a train staff swiftly helped an elderly get on to the platform and then into a train with good spirit and sincerity.  The Taipei metro is also fitted with stickers and friendly reminders of safety for its passengers. He hopes that instead of just apologizing each time a disruption occurs, SMRT should reduce the occurrences of such incidents.

Reader Yeo Thye Lye pointed out while the focus is now on finding out what caused Tuesday's unprecedented breakdown of both the East-West and North-South lines (""Independent expert to look into rail network""; Friday), SMRT should also examine why were the efforts to deal with the fallout of the breakdown still not up to mark, despite the experience with previous breakdowns. Reader also questioned why was so little attention paid to ensuring contingency plans would be well executed. He pointed out as a private organisation, SMRT would strive to maximise resources and would not have buses just lying idle, waiting to be deployed in the event of a train disruption. The same would go for SBS Transit. Mr Yeo suggested one solution is to tap private buses and wondered if any were deployed on Tuesday night. Many of them would have been available at that time of night. Finally, he pointed out there needs to be more effort and focus on contingency plans, in addition to ensuring breakdowns are kept to a minimum.
 
Reader James Chew pointed out despite free bus services were made available at all stations on the two MRT lines hit by the service disruption on Tuesday many commuters, especially children found it difficult to continue their journey. Hesuggested that it is time to establish some sort of etiquette in boarding the buses. Mr Chew pointed out that women and children should be allowed to board first, followed by the aged and the infirm. Able-bodied men should be at the back of the queue. Posters explaining this in the four local languages should be displayed at bus stops and on buses. Reader also suggested that during emergencies bus drivers and marshals should be able to direct commuters to follow this rule, as this will help to ensure that our children will not have to walk home in such situations.
 
Reader Zee Kok Eng questioned have we become complacent with the standard operating procedures, especially of our maintenance programmes. He pointed out since ours is an ageing system, we should be more vigilant and perhaps even paranoid about improving our maintenance programmes, so as to eliminate random or freak breakdowns. He drew comparisons with our train systems with that found in Tokyo.
 
In the light of the latest train breakdown, the Government needs to rethink its belief that the privatisation of key infrastructure would give better service, efficiency and cost savings, said reader John Ng Tian Siong. The problem with privatisation is that the bottom line is a key concern, and corners will be cut to maintain profitability, as any private organisation would do, he added.

SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Neutral ,"Most news agencies covered the major points highlighted in the news release yesterday, including prioritizing remedial actions over longer term track renewal works, bringing in external experts and retired staff to improve robustness of the system and help investigation, the procurement of advanced monitoring systems and the apologies made by the Board.
 
SMRT Corp will reschedule its long-term track upgrade and renewal programmes to focus on finding the root cause of what crippled the entire North-South and East-West lines on Tuesday evening. In a statement yesterday, the public transport operator said this was so that ""priority for track access during the limited maintenance hours at night can be given to immediate remedial actions"". SMRT added that it was working with external experts to review the robustness of its power network, and to find ways to further segment it to avoid a similar network-wide power failure. It has brought in some retired former staff with experience in network power issues to help investigate. The Land Transport Authority will also bring in an independent consultant specialising in transit power systems to examine the network as early as this month. Testing and investigation will continue into the weekend and SMRT will also be renacting, where possible, the scenarios where the power outages occurred.
 
SMRT chairman Koh Yong Guan again apologised for the disruption, and said that the company's board and management ""take full responsibility"" for it. He apologised to the Muslim commuters who were returning home to break fast. MP Seng Han Thong, deputy chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, urged SMRT to be transparent with its recovery operations and efforts.

SMRT Trains,Fines,Negative,"SMRT could face a fine of up to $50 million following the massive MRT disruption on Tuesday, according to a market analyst. More than 250,000 commuters were affected when train services on the North-South and East-West lines were disrupted for over two hours - in what was likely the worst MRT breakdown ever seen here. Maybank Kim Eng analyst Derrick Heng noted that new regulations approved in Parliament in February last year have given the Government expanded scope to hit transport firms with heavy fines for travel disruptions. The maximum fine was increased from $1 million to 10 per cent of the operator's annual fare revenue for the affected line.
 
The fine could push SMRT's net profit below the $119.4 million that Maybank Kim Eng forecast for this financial year. SMRT shares have been sliding since Tuesday's breakdown, losing 0.5 cent or 0.34 per cent to close at $1.48 yesterday, down 3.9 per cent for the week. As SMRT struggles under the burden some analysts believe that the Government may step in to speed up the operator's transition to the new rail financing framework (NRFF). Under the framework, the Government will own the rail system assets and bear the responsibility for capital investments. Negotiations between the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SMRT over the transition have yet to reach an agreement. They believe that expediting this framework, or allowing LTA to release funds for pre-emptive maintenance works might help SMRT with its much-needed transformation.

Forum,,,"Writer, Huang Jianye, claimed that Singapore's MRT network system has accumulated nearly 30 years of history since its launch in 1987. However, the breakdown accidents in recent years have been occurring frequently. The last massive breakdown on Tuesday along the NS and EW line had hit 54 MRT stations and 250,000 commuters with a 3.5 hour disruption, the worst in the history of local SMRT breakdowns. 

NUS Civil Engineering Professor Lee Der-Horng shared that similar train networks in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan are better namely because of their  “transit-oriented” development direction, which puts emphasis on the masses and focuses on service quality. He highlights that the Hong Kong rail network utilizes surrounding facilities to garner extra capital, rather than relying solely on fare. Taiwan is similar, its rail network are newer and as such it has not experienced such breakdowns. He states that unlike Singapore, both Taiwan and Hong Kong rail networks are structured in such a way that maintenance works may be performed normally without causing disruptions for the commuters.

Japan’s rich cultural background and excellent technology was also highlighted as contributors to its rail network’s high level of commuter service. 

The second section of the forum notes that the LTA has decided to strengthen its marketing efforts in rebuilding and enhancing the image of local public transport industry, in order to attract top talents.

Investigations are still being carried out by the police.  At present, a 40 year old man was reported to have suffered cuts, however he was not sent to the hospital.
"
SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"Editor, Han Fook Kwang, shared about the train breakdown on Tuesday and another round of commuter outrage. He highlighted that the answer to the power outage which occurred across the entire North-South and East-West lines could only be answered by engineers studying the problem and working out the solutions. However he states that our engineers are unable to identify the problem. As such, external experts are now being sought. While he agrees that railway engineering is a highly specialized field, he states that the events of Tuesday have served to emphasize how important it is for the operators and regulators to develop their own internal capability.

He highlights that in SMRT and SBST’s desire to build and run an MRT system safely, smoothly and efficiently  is first and foremost an engineering issue. Hence, both of these operators have to strive to be first-class engineering companies with a corporate mission that puts engineering at the top of their priorities. 

He goes on to highlight how difficult it is to produce top notch engineers in Singapore today. Providing examples of how society has since changed and how the best students of today would rather go into medicine, law, finance and business.   

He concludes by stating that any engineering related industry may continuously buy expertise and equipment from abroad. However as the MRT breakdowns show, we can buy the trains and the hardware but we have to develop our own internal capabilities to maintain them well and troubleshoot problems when things go awry. Singaporean engineering talents have to be nurtured.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"Straits Times interviewed experts on how best to handle the situation if a major MRT service disruption were to happened again. Last Tuesday night, when SMRT had to shut down the two lines which are the backbone of the train system, thousands of commuters spilt out of the exits of 54 stations. 

The article highlights that despite a series of recommendations by the Committee of Inquiry in 2012 following two major breakdowns in 2011, the problem of dealing with commuters in the aftermath of a breakdown remains. It was reported that SMRT did not activate its bus bridging service on Tuesday, instead it deployed any available bus resources to supplement regular bus services. SMRT has acknowledged this was one of the gaps in its service recovery.

Transport experts have since agreed that the additional buses could have been better utilized, and private bus resources could have been called on.

Several suggestions were made such as having buses bring commuters to nearby transport nodes like interchanges. NUS transport researcher suggested  having buses running parallel to MRT lines. SMU Professor Lau Hoong Chuin suggested using existing transit card data to understand commuter travel patterns, to better deploy bus bridging services. Engaging private bus operators to help during the situation was also one of the suggestions. 
"
SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"Many commuters provided feedback on the limited information that was available on the disruption. Commuters, left stranded when the North-South and East-West Lines were closed, said they were unsure of where to go, who to speak to or what to do. Experts said the lack of information given to commuters could have added to the severity of the situation. They noted that in such a situation, the key information that needs to be conveyed to commuters is: Should they wait in the station; how long the wait will be; and where they can board a bus if they have been advised to leave the station. 

Many of the commuters said that they were unable to speak to any station staff during the breakdown.

Mr Cedric Foo, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Transport, said commuters would feel even more inconvenienced if they did not know what to do and naturally tempers would flare because of the uncertainty.

Professor Lau Hoong Chuin of SMU recommended that  apps for smartphones should be developed to give users more prompt updates on the situation.

Transport consultant Tham Chen Munn said it would be useful to identify the more popular routes and prepare signs with directions.

Despite all the unhappiness, former UniSIM transport expert Park Byung Joon said that it is almost impossible to prepare for a breakdown of such a magnitude and that SMRT is much quicker at resource deployment and staff management at the stations.
"
Forum,,,"Writer, Daryl Chin, shared that social media - the platform tor venting - can also be used to great effect in sharing good news. Faced with what is likely the country's worst MRT breakdown on Tuesday, commuters took to social media to vent. Naturally, hashtag #SMRT started trending almost immediately, accompanied by photos of unhappy faces and long queues. But something changed as the night wore on and the tone shifted, where kind acts started to surface. #ThingsIDidWhenMRTWasDown - started by popular local blogger Mr Brown - began trending. The cascade of angry, vulgar posts was suddenly interspersed with levity."

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"Writer S M Ong, shared about the recent massive MRT breakdown along NS and EW lines and claimed that SMRT Group CEO Mr Desmond Kuek might have ‘jinxed’ the accident by bragging about the award received by the company hours before the massive disruption. In addition, he came up with a humorous way to determine the whether the MRT breakdown of 2011 or 2015 was worse, by the number of parody songs that one could come up with."

SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Negative,"Both articles reported that in response to the major service disruption at the North South and East West line and the inability to confirm the cause of train fault, SMRT has announced the implementation of several measures to reduce the rate of train faults. These measures include rescheduling of long-term track upgrade and renewal programmes;  continuing its testing and investigations by repeating the full cycle of checks; bringing in retired SMRT staff with experience to help with investigations; hastening the acquisition of additional condition monitoring systems; and working with external experts to review the robustness of the power network.  
 
SMRT chairman Koh Yong Guan again apologised for the disruption, and said that the company's board and management ""take full responsibility"" for it. He apologised to the Muslim commuters who were returning home to break fast. MP Seng Han Thong, deputy chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, urged SMRT to be transparent with its recovery operations and efforts.

Forum,,,"Writer, Liu Jiakeng, stated that SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek has certainly achieved celebrity status in the last two weeks after the massive MRT service disruption. Prior to the massive service disruption, Mr Kuek's large pay cheque of S$2.2m was revealed by the media. Moreover, the most severe breakdown occurred only hours after his announcement of SMRT's progress (during the AGM).

The writer highlights progress made by SMRT since Mr Kuek took charge. These achievements include the increase of number of engineers, reduced train withdrawal rates and quicker train services. Nonetheless, the writer deems that Mr Kuek's reply to the media is ‘disastrous’ making reference to a statement from the press conference on 8 July (post disruption) where Mr Kuek had told the media that ‘despite the strengthening of maintenance and inspections, it is not 100% possible to find all potential faults’. The general sentiment of the public is that Mr Kuek is not accepting responsibility and is finding an excuse to shift the blame.

Forum,,,"Reader, He Xiaohua, shares her experience of incident on SMRT bus service 187, involving an intelligent mother and an uncivilized man. The man was reported to have left his barefooted feet on the bus seats and confronted the mother when she told her son not to behave like him. However, the intelligent mother tactful avoided the confrontation by saying it her own business on how she taught her son and it was the man's own business that his mother did not teach him manners."
Forum,,,"Reader, Chan Kah Ling, started off her article by applauding  the team of SMRT engineers and staff who worked tirelessly, round the clock, to ensure that the trains were running again in the shortest time possible. However, she believes that more can be done. She suggested for a shift in focus from overcrowded trains during peak hours to developing better bus networks in Singapore's northern areas. She claims that having more bus services as alternatives to the MRT will prevent the repeat of stranded commuters in the recent MRT breakdown incident. She also added that more bus services would help ease the crowds on trains every morning."
SMRT Trains,Facilities ,Positive ,"Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health & Ministry of Transport, visited Yishun MRT station yesterday to survey the situation during morning peak period. Writing on his Facebook, Dr Faishal said he is pleased to see that the trains were running smoothly and the trains arriving at regular intervals. ""I spoke to some of the commuters who were waiting to board the train, who told me they were happy with the higher train frequencies and smoother rides. Thanks to the completion of re-sleepering works in April, trains can now travel higher speeds, resulting in shorter travelling time,"" said Mr Faishal. He also spoke to some of the friendly SMRT Service Ambassadors who were directing commuters to the less congested cabins"
SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"The 5 Show discusses about the possible reasons of the train disruption and what fellow Singaporeans have done to help each other last Tuesday. Many vented their frustration rather creatively in the Internet with several creative posts on the train disruption last Tuesday. The 5 Show revealed some witty tweets with #TheThingsIDidWhenMRTWasDown.  

Seah Lee Yan, a passenger who stuck for about 35 minutes during the incident, was interviewed. She said that when the announcement was made on the train disruption, all were calm and had no reaction to the announcement. The host, Yasminne Cheng asked whether this incident erode her confidence in the train system. Seah said it didn’t but that even if she did, she had to rely on the MRT. Seah suggested that SMRT could do better in crisis management, like better signage for directions on where to go to take bus. Seah Lee Yan also hoped that there will be more informative service announcements made. Host Yasminne suggested that passengers should have spare battery packs during such emergencies. Shawn, another commuter stuck for 40 minutes during the disruption, was interviewed over the phone. Shawn opined that for contingency, he will look for food as he pointed out that the delay could be long and not sure what time the train will resume. Shawn also suggested that service announcements should be made less contradictory and more informative, so that passengers will know what is really going on. 

The hosts shared on train’s problem around the world showing clips of trains in India, Beijing Metro, and Japan. The hosts then interviewed Dr. Lee Der-Horng, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, National University of Singapore. He pointed out that according to the statistics on a daily basis MRT ridership is at 2.4 to 2.6 million person trip. When asked if the ridership too crowded, Professor Lee said that Singapore’s peak hour system is unique and this burdens the system. The potential risk becomes apparent when many passengers board the train at the same time during peak hours.

One of the posts in Facebook pointed out that the fault could have been due to highly oxidize cables. Dr Lee explained that oxidization is probable given the underground nature of the system. Other speculations include: worn down insulation cables, faulty voltage relay at a power substation and water leakage in a tunnel section. When asked which was more probable, Dr Lee opined that the more probable reason would be the faulty insulation of the power cables. He said that  on the 7 July, there were too many power trips which resulted in the system being unable to reset itself and hence it was shut down. The maintenance crew was required to enter the site to fix the issue. Dr Lee also highlighted that another reason for the shut down was safety concerns. In the event of a power trip, the system’s overall reliability becomes unknown and  the engineers have to perform inspection to make sure the system is actually safe. Dr Lee said that they did not want to have any power leakages which would also affect the passengers. If that really happens it will be with consequential. 

“For the MRT system the power trip is quite a common phenomena, but to the scale it was on 7 July, it was not very common,” he said. Dr Lee pointed out that Singapore could learn from the Hong Kong MTR, given the common infrastructure and social environment. He also points out that their ridership is higher than ours.

Professor Lee does not think that sabotage is the reason for the train disruption. 

The 5 Show then went on to show pictures from the Internet on the day of the incident, such carpooling with strangers, Mc Donald’s and Changi Airport serving drinks to the people waiting and there were another post by Iris Lee, whose father works with SMRT as an engineer. He received notification and he went down as he went to help out and stood and said sorry at least 100 times to everyone who passed him. The host pointed out that by doing this, the SMRT worker had helped to diffuse negativity. Another post complimented a bus driver of Bus 853, for being capable, nice, patience and professional in controlling the crowd. He was even being called an angel during the down time. 

The hosts then went on to  ask what SMRT could should do in future regarding checks and maintenance. Dr Lee referred to the previous train major breakdown in December 2011 where the Prime Minister instructed the setting up of the Committee Inquiry, and the final report mentioned that the breakdown could have been avoided if the maintenance was in place. Professor Lee said that this sends a very strong signal to the operator that proper maintenance should always be there, in terms of intensity, regularity and overall thoroughness to take the public transport system. As MRT is the major trunk line, rail should be received strong attention when it comes to maintenance. Dr Lee also explained that apart from the reliability issue, we also need to focus on the resilience issue. Even if the system is not in service, if we are able to make use of alternatives, the commuters would believe that the Singaporean transportation system is resilient.  He points out that with the upcoming train lines in the future, in the event of a breakdown, commuters will have more alternatives to reach to their destination.  He cites London as an example, where cable cars are used as alternative transport.

Dr Lee wishes that SMRT will be more transparent. He says that if he were in their shoes he would tell commuters what the company has been doing and what new steps the company is planning to take moving ahead.

SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Neutral ,"A team of Swedish and Japanese experts have been appointed to conduct an independent assessment of the North-South and East-West lines' power supply and track-side infrastructure, following the July 7 train disruptions.

The team consists of four experts from Sweden's Parsons Brinkerhoff and a traction power expert from Meidensha Corporation, a Tokyo-based company with extensive experience in power supply.

They will be led by Mr Mats Onner from Parsons, and Mr Hiroto Ikeda from Meidensha, and will be given ""full access to the infrastructure and installations along the NSEWL during non-service hours"", LTA said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The team of experts, closely assisted by engineers from LTA and SMRT, will also be analysing the data collated by LTA and SMRT engineers since the incident.”

""They will also review the current condition of the power supply and trackside installations, as well as provide recommendations to enhance the overall system and its maintenance,"" said LTA, adding that this assessment is expected to be completed in August. Parson was the consultant for mechanical services on both lines, while Meidensha had also designed and installed the power supply systems on them.

The Lianhe ZaoBao front page feature also reported that SMRT will be initiating independent efforts to collaborate with experts to investigate and modify the power supply system of the NSEWL. The current goal is to create separate power supplies for the two lines, so as to ensure that when one line breaks down due to power supply issues, another line will remain operational.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"Speaking on Channel 5's Talking Point with LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong and Professor Lee Der Horng, from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at NUS, SMRT Trains Managing Director Lee Ling Wee revealed that it was a tough call to stop train service during a breakdown that affected Singapore's two main MRT lines last week. Lee said that he wanted to do whatever he could to keep the trains running. However, if service continued running, there was the risk of trains being stuck in between stations, and passengers  (around 15,000) would have to evacuate onto the tracks.

He said that impact of the disruption was ‘unprecedented’ and admitted that SMRT was not able to handle last week's massive train disruption on its own, despite deploying 700 additional staff that night. He suggested setting up a taskforce involving LTA and other enforcement agencies. Chew replied  by saying that they had mobilised whatever assets they could on the night, including buses from SBS Transit. The authority was also planning to call on private bus operators if it had to, as back-up

Lee also pointed out that the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) were the first major lines to be built. He said that the trains indicate that they are towards the end of their life span, when they see a spike in defect rates. He noted that they must move beyond this phase when they are renewing their assets.

On the cause of the power trips preceding last Tuesday’s outage of the NSEWL, Lee suggested that issue of insulation on the third rail is the prime suspect, although he stopped short of pinpointing it as the cause. “The third rail system is ... almost 30 years old, and some of these insulators are ageing, so there’s a possibility that some of it is loose ... and, therefore, may end up with certain leakage of current that could have led to the trips,” he said.

Several street interviews were conducted with commuters who gave the reliability rating of 6-7 out of 10, but asked about measures taken to ensure disruptions are minimized.

Several street interviews were conducted with commuters who gave the reliability rating of 6-7 out of 10, but asked about measures taken to ensure disruptions are minimized.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"Speaking on Channel 5's Talking Point with LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong and Professor Lee Der Horng, from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at NUS, SMRT Trains Managing Director Lee Ling Wee revealed that it was a tough call to stop train service during a breakdown that affected Singapore's two main MRT lines last week. Lee said that he wanted to do whatever he could to keep the trains running. However, if service continued running, there was the risk of trains being stuck in between stations, and passengers  (around 15,000) would have to evacuate onto the tracks.

He said that impact of the disruption was ‘unprecedented’ and admitted that SMRT was not able to handle last week's massive train disruption on its own, despite deploying 700 additional staff that night. He suggested setting up a taskforce involving LTA and other enforcement agencies. Chew replied  by saying that they had mobilised whatever assets they could on the night, including buses from SBS Transit. The authority was also planning to call on private bus operators if it had to, as back-up

Lee also pointed out that the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) were the first major lines to be built. He said that the trains indicate that they are towards the end of their life span, when they see a spike in defect rates. He noted that they must move beyond this phase when they are renewing their assets.

Forum,,,"Writer Tan Wu Meng said that SMRT’s latest breakdown across the North-South and East-West artery lines is a major concern, all the more so because the underlying root causes remain unclear. He then compares the incident to healthcare, where  it will be hard to prescribe the best treatment unless a proper diagnosis is achieved. 

The writer suggests that one way to master this complexity is through the use of big data. He highlights SMRT’s collaboration with IBM, Starhub and the LTA in starting a big research collaboration to study commuter movements. To the writer, big data in the national rail infrastructure is necessary for the operator and authorities to be better able to prepare and predict system failures.
"
Forum,,,"Reader, Wayson Bay, claimed that it is not possible to maintain a 100 per cent breakdown-free MRT system, but more can be done in contingency measures when breakdowns do occur. He suggested that the authorities look into imposing a cut-off time as commuters should not be trapped for a long time while the operator ponders its next action. Moreover, crowds should be dispersed quickly. 

At bus stops near affected stations, free rides on public bus services — not limited to the train operator’s buses — should be provided in the initial hours of the breakdown. 

Finally, announcements about affected lines should be made in all MRT stations, instead of having operators providing the status of train services only about their own lines.
"
Forum,,,"Reader, Karen Koh Zhen Yu, suggested the equivalent in free trips for commuters instead of the hefty fine such as S$50 million against SMRT. She claimed that fining SMRT would be a quick punishment for last week’s breakdown but free trips will be real compensation for people's time and money spent to get home or to work.

She compares SMRT’s rail transport operations to those of Japan, Korea and Taiwan where the rail systems are bigger and more complex. She states that the rail systems in these countries are able to follow train schedules strictly allowing commuters to plan trips for not only a day but even a month. She argues that SMRT has not reached this standard yet, and even then the company is facing such major breakdowns.
"
Forum,,,"In response to the various MRT breakdowns in 2015 and the hot debates on the issue, writer, Zhou Yi, shared his reflections on the issue. He highlighted three areas of concerns namely the availability of alternative train routes, the need for a strong engineering team as the core to troubleshoot complex rail systems and the decreasing number of local talents in engineering, especially for the rail sectors.

The opinion piece focuses more on the lack of rail engineers in Singapore, citing perceived unattractive career prospects as one of the main causes. 

The writer acknowledges that SMRT has been making efforts to improve this. The STEP programme for SMRT engineers and the chartering of SMRT rail engineers were highlighted as initiatives which SMRT has taken to improve the situation.

The writer concludes by saying that Rome was not built in a day. Similarly, the solutions to these problems will take time before their effects are felt by the commuters.

SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Neutral ,"A team of Swedish and Japanese experts have been appointed to conduct an independent assessment of the North-South and East-West lines' power supply and track-side infrastructure, following the July 7 train disruptions.

The team consists of four experts from Sweden's Parsons Brinkerhoff and a traction power expert from Meidensha Corporation, a Tokyo-based company with extensive experience in power supply.

They will be led by Mr Mats Onner from Parsons, and Mr Hiroto Ikeda from Meidensha, and will be given ""full access to the infrastructure and installations along the NSEWL during non-service hours"", LTA said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The team of experts, closely assisted by engineers from LTA and SMRT, will also be analysing the data collated by LTA and SMRT engineers since the incident.”

""They will also review the current condition of the power supply and trackside installations, as well as provide recommendations to enhance the overall system and its maintenance,"" said LTA, adding that this assessment is expected to be completed in August. Parson was the consultant for mechanical services on both lines, while Meidensha had also designed and installed the power supply systems on them.

SMRT will also be initiating independent efforts to collaborate with experts to investigate and modify the power supply system of the NSEWL. The current goal is to create separate power supplies for the two lines, so as to ensure that when one line breaks down due to power supply issues, another line will remain operational.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"SMRT has narrowed down the likely cause of the July 7 disruption to the insulation of the third rail, which is used to protect power cables that supply electricity to the third rail, saying that “ intensive, round-the-clock investigations” and re-enactments of the incident “point to the likelihood that the insulation of the third rail could have affected the supply of traction power”. This in turn, led to the tripping of the Touch Voltage Protection Relay along multiple stretches of the lines. The relays are a safety measure meant to protect commuters from unsafe “ touch voltage.”

According to its media release on Thursday, SMRT ran a comprehensive investigation over the past nine days that covered 200 kilometers of train tracks on both bounds of the NSEWL, all 67 power substations that support the lines and all 115 MRT trains that were used on that day, along with 26 additional trains at train depots.

The rail operator has also engaged in independent consultation, approaching the London Underground for their views on its preliminary assessment of the disruption.Retired staff were also engaged to aid in investigative efforts.

“SMRT is taking all possible precautionary and preventive measures to safeguard the system in terms of safety and service reliability,” said the company’s media release. 

As a future measure, SMRT is speeding up its efforts to improve the robustness of the network of power cables, switches and substations that provide traction power to trains on the North-South East-West Lines (NSEWL).

The unprecedented disruption on the NSEWL highlights the urgency for SMRT engineering staff to renew the lines’ power-related infrastructure, and SMRT announced it would work with LTA to segment where possible, the network of cables that supply power to the North-South and East-West Lines. This design improvement would make a power fault on one part of a line less likely to disrupt travel on other parts or the other line.

“SMRT is taking all possible precautionary and preventive measures to safeguard the system in terms of safety and service reliability,” said the company’s media release. 

As a future measure, SMRT is speeding up its efforts to improve the robustness of the network of power cables, switches and substations that provide traction power to trains on the North-South East-West Lines (NSEWL).

The unprecedented disruption on the NSEWL highlights the urgency for SMRT engineering staff to renew the lines’ power-related infrastructure, and SMRT announced it would work with LTA to segment where possible, the network of cables that supply power to the North-South and East-West Lines. This design improvement would make a power fault on one part of a line less likely to disrupt travel on other parts or the other line.

SMRT Buses,Facilities ,Neutral ,"Commuters are getting more accurate bus arrival timings on their mobile apps and information panels at bus stops. LTA said yesterday improvements made to its information systems mean that 95 per cent of estimated timings now fall within three minutes of the actual arrival times. This is an increase from about 80 per cent from April, when the bus arrival information system was launched. Previously, bus operators SBS Transit and SMRT operated their own arrival information systems, but the LTA started installing a new centralised system last year. Under it, all 4,700 public buses are attached with global positioning devices that send location data to the LTA.

The LTA said it will launch a common bus fleet management system in the middle of next year to control intervals and reduce “bunching”.

LTA’s group director for innovation and infocomm technology, Ms Rosina Howe said this system will monitor whether buses arrive at their stops according to schedule, and also communicate with drivers.

Despite claims of an improved accuracy from the authority, some passengers are still complaining about the unreliable and inaccurate information provided by the MyTransport.SG app. The problem started when the LTA integrated the arrival information systems of the two bus operators in April. Field checks by The Straits Times at five bus stops yesterday found the system to be accurate in 19 out of 27 instances, giving it a success rate of 70  per cent.

Transport consultant Bruno Wildermuth said a bus arrival app “is useless as long as they don’t publish a bus timetable.”

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"Christopher Tan says SMRT needs to improve the way it manages breakdowns urgently, while waiting for new trains, a new third rail and other upgrades to the system. In the first quarter of this year, there were five major service disruptions, each lasting more than 30 minutes. Twelve disruptions happened last year - more than the 11 in 2011, the year that rail breakdown rippled across the corporate and political spheres.

He states that satisfaction is by and large , a function of expectations. When then Communications Mah Bow Tan promised Singaporeans in 1995 that they would have a world class land transport system, it set expectations fairly high. The promise was delivered for a while. However when transport regulators and operators failed to plan for a population explosion that took place between 2000 and 2010, things began to unravel.

Chris juxtaposes this with commuters in Tokyo. He says while they are unhappy with how crowded their trains are, the high reliability helps them bear with the crowdedness better. The Japanese have built an impeccably robust system with lots of inherent redundancy. So, even if one system failed, the operators could switch to another. Secondly, their maintenance regimen, involves major overhauls, where trains are stripped completely, and individual components are inspected, cleaned and replaced when necessary. Thirdly, their well trained employees take pride in what they do.

While there are massive efforts by SMRT and LTA in expanding and fixing the network, it will take a few more years before the vast majority of commuters see a noticeable improvement. Thus it would be good for SMRT and LTA can prepare themselves (better) for the next breakdown and look into the following points during a crisis:

•         All bus rides should be free of charge, as commuters do not know which buses are free and which are not.
•         Train fares on unaffected lines should be waived. Likewise for fares on affected lines which have been fixed.
•         Taxifares should be halved.
•         Fare refunds should be made more efficient as breakdowns will also result in long queues of people waiting to get refunds, which results in congestion. He provides the example of modern fare systems with a “white list” feature where a refund is automatically given the next time a stored value card is used.

In his conclusion he states that a massive breakdown, while not a national crisis, can easily spiral into a public order situation, as anxiety and emotions rise in a confusing situation. The regulator and operator should be more proactive in working with transport operators on contingency options. He also states that our inability to cope well with major breakdowns is demonstrated time and again. This must stop, the next time trains ground to a halt.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"LTA and SMRT announced their findings three weeks after the disruption on 7 July, saying that an accumulation of salty deposits on an electrical component on the East-West Line had triggered the massive rail breakdown. This was one of a ""confluence of factors"" that caused a power trip leading to the breakdown of the NSEWL.

LTA deputy chief executive for infrastructure and development Chua Chong Kheng said a leak at a stretch of tunnel between Tanjong Pagar and Raffles Place MRT stations resulted in water with high chloride content dripping near one of the rail insulators, leading to surface contamination. The contaminated insulator became less effectiveness and resulted in a higher than normal voltage difference between the running rail and the ground. This led to a tripping of the power system.

SMRT will be changing out third rail insulators with low resistance in the next four to six weeks. In the longer run, it replace all 30,000 insulators within the network.

SMRT will be stepping up its maintenance efforts and look into ways to pre-empt future problems. To better monitor the condition of the insulators, SMRT will install data loggers at all 47 traction power sub stations along the NSEWL in the next two months. It will also de-sensitise the touch voltage protection relay by raising its setting from 136V to 200V. This will make it less susceptible to power trips.

In the long term, it will implement voltage limiting devices which are being tested in the Downtown Line. These will isolate power trips.

To better monitor the condition of the insulators, SMRT will install data loggers at all 47 traction power sub stations along the NSEWL in the next two months. It will also de-sensitise the touch voltage protection relay by raising its setting from 136V to 200V. This will make it less susceptible to power trips.

In the long term, it will implement voltage limiting devices which are being tested in the Downtown Line. These will isolate power trips.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"LTA and SMRT announced their findings three weeks after the disruption on 7 July, saying that an accumulation of salty deposits on an electrical component on the East-West Line had triggered the massive rail breakdown. This was one of a ""confluence of factors"" that caused a power trip leading to the breakdown of the NSEWL.

LTA deputy chief executive for infrastructure and development Chua Chong Kheng said a leak at a stretch of tunnel between Tanjong Pagar and Raffles Place MRT stations resulted in water with high chloride content dripping near one of the rail insulators, leading to surface contamination. The contaminated insulator became less effectiveness and resulted in a higher than normal voltage difference between the running rail and the ground. This led to a tripping of the power system.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"According to figures on LTA’s  website, there were five train service delays lasting more than 30 minutes between January and March this year. This was almost half of the 12 such disruptions for the whole of last year; there were eight such delays each in 2012 and 2013. 

Asked yesterday why the number of major disruptions is creeping up despite the lessons learnt from earlier disruptions in 2011, LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong noted that much has been done to boost reliability, such as the upgrading of key assets on the North-South and East-West lines- sleepers, signaling and the third rails.

SMRT chief executive Desmond Kuek said that it “takes time” to develop new condition monitoring systems, which are not readily available on the shelf.

Forum,,,"Reader, Jonathan Toh Joo Khai, suggested a raise in train fares if we must, but continue to offer discounts to students and targeted assistance to the needy. He claimed that the fare hikes, which are regulated by Public Transport Council (PTC), are miserly compared with the rate of inflation. In addition, train fares in Singapore are low relative to gross domestic product per capita. According to the reader, this is the root cause of SMRT's frequent train breakdowns."
SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"The Singapore golden jubilee (SG50), evoked a sense of pride for the local residents, including youths, who have high aspirations of improving their lives in their homeland. Many youths want a good career. At the same time they are concerned about the cost of living and the quality of the transport system which have seen frequent disruptions recently. Such were the views of participants in a table discussion session regarding the coming general election - Discussion on General Election with Young Voters - organized by Berita Harian. Five young voters from various background took part in the session. Ms Juzaila Jamari, a kindergarten teacher, 34, said that the 7th July disruption on MRT service 'cannot be accepted'. More than 250,000 commuters were affected when the North-South and East-West MRT lines (NSEWL) were disrupted for a few hours during peak hours."

With regards to the penalties for SMRT, LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong said that it will continue to investigate the cause of incident and decide later.

•         The core rail business plunged by more than 230 per cent to register a loss of S$5.7 million - from a profit of S$4.3 million same time last year.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"The article is a reproduction of yesterday’s Straits Time’s article titled “SMRT's Contingency Plans Need Fixing”. Christopher Tan claimed that the rail operator needs to improve the way it manages breakdowns urgently, while waiting for new trains, a new third rail and other upgrades to the MRT system. He added that in the first quarter of this year, there were five major service disruptions, each lasting more than 30 minutes. These exclude a fire that stopped the Bukit Panjang LRT service for 24 hours. As it will take a few years before commuters feel the effect of the renewal works that are on-going, he suggested SMRT and LTA to prepare themselves for the next major breakdown better and not let the inability to cope well with major breakdowns to be demonstrated time and again."
Forum,,,"Reader, Zheng Zhaorong, shared several instances of difficulty getting seats on crowded trains, adding that passengers occupying the reserved seats ignore the presence of other needy passengers. He cited several examples overseas and urged local authorities to learn from them to improve the graciousness of passengers.  "
SMRT Buses,Financials,Neutral ,"Singapore's third bus operator, Tower Transit, took another step towards hitting the roads here yesterday when the Bulim Bus Depot was handed over by LTA. In addition to the depot, LTA will also hand over 380 buses, comprising new buses and existing ones being used on the routes by SMRT and SBS Transit, for deployment at a later date. Moreover, Tower Transit is expected to begin staff recruitment next month and discussions with NTWU on the “finer points” of employment terms are close to completion. It will need to hire about 700 bus captains - more than the 400 or so existing SBS Transit and SMRT staff whose jobs will be affected when services are transferred to the new operator. If they choose to stay on the same route, they will join Tower Transit, while those who prefer to stay with the incumbents will service other routes.

Their interests remain a key concern of the NTWU and Tower Transit has pledged to offer employment to each affected worker at similar or better terms.

Bus captains on the affected routes told The Straits Times they are ready to move over.

Tower Transit had won other competitors like SBS Transit and SMRT in May and was awarded the first local open tender of new bus contracting model. It will operate 26 bus services starting from mid-2016.

Forum,,,"Reader, Mrs Xiao, reported that her peak hour train yesterday evening on Circle Line was moving very slowly and stopped several times after she boarded at Labrador Park MRT station towards Bishan. She added that the train had stopped for nearly 10 mins at Buona Vista station and her ride took 20 mins longer than usual. Many commuters were frustrated and complaining. Others simply transferred to other modes of transport.

The reporter decided to pay Bishan station a visit at around 7pm and noticed a huge crowd. However comments by the interviewed passengers revealed they were not affected. In addition, there was no information of the incident on SMRT official Facebook and Twitter page.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Negative,"Christopher Tan says SMRT needs to improve the way it manages breakdowns urgently, while waiting for new trains, a new third rail and other upgrades to the system. In the first quarter of this year, there were five major service disruptions, each lasting more than 30 minutes. Twelve disruptions happened last year - more than the 11 in 2011, the year that rail breakdown rippled across the corporate and political spheres.

He states that satisfaction is by and large , a function of expectations. When then Communications Mah Bow Tan promised Singaporeans in 1995 that they would have a world class land transport system, it set expectations fairly high. The promise was delivered for a while. However when transport regulators and operators failed to plan for a population explosion that took place between 2000 and 2010, things began to unravel.

Chris juxtaposes this with commuters in Tokyo. He says while they are unhappy with how crowded their trains are, the high reliability helps them bear with the crowdedness better. The Japanese have built an impeccably robust system with lots of inherent redundancy. So, even if one system failed, the operators could switch to another. Secondly, their maintenance regimen, involves major overhauls, where trains are stripped completely, and individual components are inspected, cleaned and replaced when necessary. Thirdly, their well trained employees take pride in what they do.

While there are massive efforts by SMRT and LTA in expanding and fixing the network, it will take a few more years before the vast majority of commuters see a noticeable improvement. Thus it would be good for SMRT and LTA can prepare themselves (better) for the next breakdown and look into the following points during a crisis:

•         All bus rides should be free of charge, as commuters do not know which buses are free and which are not.
•         Train fares on unaffected lines should be waived. Likewise for fares on affected lines which have been fixed.
•         Taxifares should be halved.
•         Fare refunds should be made more efficient as breakdowns will also result in long queues of people waiting to get refunds, which results in congestion. He provides the example of modern fare systems with a “white list” feature where a refund is automatically given the next time a stored value card is used.

In his conclusion he states that a massive breakdown, while not a national crisis, can easily spiral into a public order situation, as anxiety and emotions rise in a confusing situation. The regulator and operator should be more proactive in working with transport operators on contingency options. He also states that our inability to cope well with major breakdowns is demonstrated time and again. This must stop, the next time trains ground to a halt.

In addition to the depot, LTA will also hand over 380 buses, comprising new buses and existing ones being used on the routes by SMRT and SBS Transit, for deployment at a later date. Moreover, Tower Transit is expected to begin staff recruitment next month and discussions with NTWU on the “finer points” of employment terms are close to completion. It will need to hire about 700 bus captains - more than the 400 or so existing SBS Transit and SMRT staff whose jobs will be affected when services are transferred to the new operator. If they choose to stay on the same route, they will join Tower Transit, while those who prefer to stay with the incumbents will service other routes.

Their interests remain a key concern of the NTWU and Tower Transit has pledged to offer employment to each affected worker at similar or better terms.

Bus captains on the affected routes told The Straits Times they are ready to move over.

Tower Transit had won other competitors like SBS Transit and SMRT in May and was awarded the first local open tender of new bus contracting model. It will operate 26 bus services starting from mid-2016.

SMRT Corporate,Repair/Maintenance ,Positive ,"In the first quarter of this fiscal year, SMRT reportedly spent $90m in three months for maintenance projects on SMRT. This amounted to nearly half of company's revenue and the maintenance cost is expected to increase further in the upcoming days. SMRT Chief executive Desmond Kuek revealed that the company has also been spending nearly half of its revenue on maintenance works in the past quarters. SMRT posted a 10 percent fall in  net profit to $20.1 million for the three months to June 30, down from the S$22.4 million in the same period a year ago, although the turnover rose by 7.8 per cent to S$320.3 million. The lower earnings were due largely to drooping profit from operations, especially its core rail business, as well as higher expenses aimed at supporting the ageing rail system and meeting tightened regulatory standards. Staff costs accounted for the biggest hike of $10 million. SMRT said during the briefing that its headcount grew by 250 during the quarter. Year-on-year, it was higher by about 500.

Mr Kuek said, “ For every one dollar we earn, half of it is dedicated to repair and maintenance.” “We will have to hire more to meet some of these requirements,” he said a day after the transport firm unveiled its first quarter results.

This includes hiring technicians and engineers, installing instruments for monitoring  and maintenance.

The three Chinese articles also highlighted SMRT’s  various initiatives such as replacing the third rails on the NSEWL line, changing insulators. The claws and fasteners used on the tracks will also be replaced. Additionally to prevent the breakdown which occurred on the 7th July 2015 from happening again, the rail company is also intending to replace all 30000 insulators on its network. These measures are expected to further increase costs incurred by the company.

SMRT Trains,Customer Service ,Positive ,"Commuters travelling on the Circle and North East lines will soon have shorter waiting times. Seven new trains have been put into service on the Circle Line since June 24, and a further three to five will be deployed by the end of this year, LTA said in a media statement yesterday. It is part of a plan to roll out 24 new trains on the Circle Line by the middle of next year, boosting capacity by 60 per cent, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew told the media yesterday, after taking a ride on one of the new trains.

There are 47 trains on the Circle Line - including the seven new ones. At the moment, commuters wait an average of 3.5 minutes during peak hours for a ride. This will be cut to 2.7 minutes. During off-peak periods, commuters will have to wait only five minutes, down from an average of seven minutes.

The new trains have ""commuter-centric"" features such as additional straphangers and gap fillers to reduce the gap between the platform and trains, said LTA.

The book emphasizes that while height is a factor that most people are unable to change in their lives, what people can do is change their attitudes. Using the book as a metaphor she cites the frequent MRT breakdowns as an example. It stated that if SMRT Corporation had prioritized the convenience of the public and adopted a different attitude during the service disruptions, then the public would be more understanding towards the authorities."

SMRT Corporate,Fares,Positive ,"More coverage on Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew’s announcement that bus and train fares will be reduced by up to 1.9 per cent in December, as a result of falling fuel costs. He said he would leave it to the PTC to work out the specific reductions but expects every commuter group to pay lower fares.

In a separate section under the heading, “ Fare reduction has nothing to do with general elections”, Mr Lui states: “No, not really. I mean it’s just that I think it’s just more convenient to not have to tweak the fare system twice.” NUS transport researcher Professor Lee Der Horng believes that while Mr Lui’s statement is reasonable, fare reviews should be pegged to specific dates in order to prevent the public from misconceiving any ulterior motives.

The third section of the front page highlighted that the passenger capacity on the Circle Line will increase by 60 per cent within the space of about a year, with 24 new trains to be added from the current 40 trains.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Positive ,"The topic of discussion  for the programme sheds light on what should commuters do when there a disruption occurs on the MRT. Last month, train services on the NSEWL were disrupted for at least 3.5 hours, leaving some 250,000 passengers stranded as they jostled for free bus services.
The cause of the disruption has been identified due to ""weak electrical resistance"" of the train network's third rail insulator. SMRT Vice-President Rail Operations, Alvin Kek, advised commuters to use the communication system in the train to contact the control centre and phone apps to check the situation.

SMRT Buses,Customer Service ,Positive ,"An experiment is underway to see if commuters are willing to pay about $4 to $6 during rush hour for a bus trip — from four housing estates in the east and north-east, for a start — to the Central Business District (CBD). Passengers get guaranteed seats and there are no more than five stops along the way. Called Beeline, it kicked off on Monday (Aug 3) with five on-demand express bus services run by private operators, and at least 10 other routes are expected in the coming months.

Currently, there are four morning peak period routes running from Marine Parade, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Tampines to the CBD, and one evening peak-period route from the CBD back to Marine Parade.

The three private bus companies running the routes are SMRT subsidiary Bus-Plus, Aedge Holdings and Commute Solution groups.

Bus-Plus is running three of the Beeline routes. “Beeline will provide commuters with another option in journey planning, and we are anticipating positive commuter experience feedback on the first routes introduced,” said Mr Benny Lim, Managing Director of SMRT Roads.

She replied a review was indeed conducted and it was found that the contingency plans of rail operator SMRT were “not adequate” to handle the scale of the breakdown.

“The capacity of alternative travel connections between the heartland and the city need considerable strengthening, and would required  significantly more resources beyond SMRT’s to mitigate the impact”, she added.

Responding to another question by Mr Cedric Foo, on whether investments could be better made to prevent major rail disruptions, through redundancy or isolating breakdowns to specific rail segments, rather than to invest in a large-scale contingency plan that would involve tapping resources of buses and drivers, she said that given the ageing rail system, resources have to be concurrently invested in preventive maintenance and improving contingency plans.

SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Neutral ,"Transport Minister Mr Lui Tuck Yew and WP Non-Constituency MP Gerald Giam had a protracted debate over the lifespan of rail assets and the need for replacements. Mr Giam said rail operator SMRT's website indicates that some rail assets had not been replaced in a timely manner and could have caused disruptions to train services. Mr Lui, however, said parts typically wear out at different rates, and are replaced on an ad-hoc basis. Using the example of timber sleepers, he told Parliament that while two different sets were used, those which were installed later actually wore out more quickly. This is because of factors such as the type of wood used and how the wood was treated.

""The important thing is actually to monitor them on a consistent level, replace them on an ad-hoc basis as and when necessary,"" he said. He added there is a need to deconflict works that are ongoing, such as sleeper replacement and upgrading signalling system, but the replacement of third rail faced a “slight delay” and could be completed only by 2017.  When asked if replacement works could have started earlier, pre-2012, before the end of life of the system, Mr Lui replied that it is not always clear what the end of life is, and while estimates can be given, perfect foresight is as rare as 20/20 hindsight is common.

Mr Lui also said that the cost of replacement and renewal of the rail system is partially paid for by the Government, with the rest coming from rail operators. But lacklustre maintenance work has led to the system wearing out faster than it should, so the Government is making SMRT cover a larger portion of the cost than what was initially agreed, said Mr Lui.

Mr Giam also asked if it is the responsibility of LTA or the operators to initiate asset renewal and if there were any conflicts between LTA and SMRT. Mr Lui said it was the operator’s responsibility as it has the best idea of the condition of the components. He added that a “certain healthy tension” is expected between the two parties as one does audit and feedback to the operator to take certain actions. He said joint teams report to him every three months and the LTA has stepped up planned and surprise audits on operators, and even embedded an audit team in SMRT itself.

Mr Giam also asked if it is the responsibility of LTA or the operators to initiate asset renewal and if there were any conflicts between LTA and SMRT. Mr Lui said it was the operator’s responsibility as it has the best idea of the condition of the components. He added that a “certain healthy tension” is expected between the two parties as one does audit and feedback to the operator to take certain actions. He said joint teams report to him every three months and the LTA has stepped up planned and surprise audits on operators, and even embedded an audit team in SMRT itself.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Neutral ,"It is premature to conclude that design flaws resulted in the major MRT train disruption on July 7 said Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew. 

Responding to a question raised by Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Gerald Giam, Mr Lui said: ""As to whether it was design or maintenance flaws that precipitated the incident, I would say that LTA’s investigations are ongoing and it is perhaps pre-mature to pre-judge the conclusion.” Mr Lui went on to highlight the main factual points of the incident, including the discovery of chloride deposits and the activation of the 64p safety mechanism to be activated. He added that SMRT is taking several interim measures such as replacing all third rail insulators and combed through NSEWL tunnels to ensure there are no other leaks with water dripping onto trackside installations.

Bus service capacity will be boosted in the event of a train disruption, such as the major breakdown on 7th July. Senior Minister of State for Transport Josephine Teo told the House on Monday that SMRT emergency measures towards the MRT breakdown was insufficient on that evening. However, LTA has reviewed the measures and worked with both bus operators to focus on an emergency ramp-up of capacity on bus connections, which include additional trunk bus services calling at MRT stations hit by major breakdowns.

In response to the major MRT breakdown earlier last month, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew claimed that it is not a design problem as the latter would have problems surfacing in 3-5 years after launch and not 25 years later. He added that the breakdown in July was due to a third rail insulator fault, resulting in multiple power trips along North South line. In addition, SMRT was noted to have implemented countermeasures such as replacing all existing third rail insulators. Moreover, it also conducted thorough checks in tunnels along North South and East West Line to ensure the problem of water leakage would not happen again

Here are some of the points he made:
• He cited figures stating that major disruptions has risen, and 2015 is the worst year so far for delays lasting more than 30 minutes
• He remarked that the incident on 7 July is the last straw that broke the camel’s back (MoT’s resignation).
• Examples of failed privatised transport companies in Britain and Melbourne were mentioned as his case for unfettered competition leading to financially strapped companies, cherry-picking of routes, lack of coordination and service gaps.
• He argued that after decades of deregulation and privatisation from the 1970s, countries are beginning to realise public sector involvement is crucial to the success of public transport
• He made a case for a hybrid model, which the government is moving towards, and highlighted successful cases such as Taiwan Metro. Though he mentioned that it would mean that the government will have to subsidise more for better service standards.
• He added that while many of the plans were already in blueprint stage when Mr Lui took over, it was Mr Lui who executed most of them and his policies “were full of heart”, citing examples of the various welfare initiatives he has put in place to shield lower-income groups from fare hikes.
• He also commented that Mr Lui remains the only transport minister who has “taken an operator to task publicly”, citing his summoning of SMRT’s top honchos for a spate of incidents in 2012. Christopher Tan also claimed that MoT introduced the new penalty framework that could make SMRT face up to $50 million for the 07 Jul incident.
• He concluded that the next transport minister has large shoes to fill

SMRT Corporate,Financials,Neutral ,"The buying surged for the third straight week while the selling among directors remained very low, based on filings on Singapore Exchange in the fourth week of August. The bulk of the purchases last week were made following the steep fall in share prices with buybacks in several companies including SMRT Corporation. Chairman Koh Yong Guan and directors Tan Beng Hai, Tan Ek Kia, Yap Kim Wah, Tan Boon Heng, Yap Chee Meng and Ang Peng Koon acquired shares of rail, bus, and taxi operator SMRT Corporation with a combined 73,000 shares purchased on Aug 24 at S$1.15 each. The acquisitions were made on the back of the 36 per cent drop in the share price since February from S$1.80.

SMRT Trains,Repair/Maintenance ,Neutral ,"International engineering firm Parsons Brinckerhoff will conduct a comprehensive health check on Singapore's rail network. The American-based company beat rivals such as SKM (Singapore), CKM Consultants and TUV Rheinland to clinch a pair of contracts worth close to $14 million in total. The deal is deemed to involve the most comprehensive assessment of the network since the first MRT line opened in 1987. The first contract will analyse the condition of the operating system, while the other will examine its infrastructure.

r

rParsons Brinckerhoff refused to comment on the deal, saying it was “highly sensitive” and it had signed an NDA with LTA. Senior ST reporter Christopher Tan said LTA and SMRT has hired retired rail experts such as Mr Wong Wai Keong, ex-chief executive of SBST Downtown Line division to “get to the nub of” major rail breakdowns – lasting more than 30 minutes. Unnamed rail experts and former SMRT engineers told ST that the incident could have been prevented if the MRT tunnels had been washed thoroughly and regularly to prevent salt deposits from accumulating. It was puzzling to many experts that power trips that occurred on 7 Jul could extend to the whole network, since they are always isolated and whole series of trips just does not happen all at once."

It does not expect SMRT's share price to retest the low seen in early 2014 as it project SMRT earnings to remain above FY14's S$62 million.

SMRT Corporate,Customer Satisfaction,Positive ,"The latest 2015 second quarter Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG) conducted by the Institute of Service Excellence at the Singapore Management University (ISES) revealed that commuters seem to be happier with Singapore's public transport system, particularly taxi services and public buses, which recorded marked improvements, said a quarterly survey. 

Satisfaction levels for taxi services was up 4.3 per cent from a year ago to 65.9 points, while participants gave public buses a higher score of 60.9 points, up 4.1 per cent. 

In addition, the MRT sub-sector also saw higher scores across both SMRT and SBS trains, notching an overall 62 points an increase of 3.7 per cent over 2014. Some media, including Channel NewAsia (CNA), highlighted that the survey was done prior to the major rail disruption in July 2015. ISES noted that July 7 incident may have negatively impacted commuter satisfaction since.

SMRT Corporate,Customer Satisfaction,Positive ,"The latest 2015 second quarter Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG) conducted by the Institute of Service Excellence at the Singapore Management University (ISES) revealed that commuters seem to be happier with Singapore's public transport system, particularly taxi services and public buses, which recorded marked improvements, said a quarterly survey. 

Satisfaction levels for taxi services was up 4.3 per cent from a year ago to 65.9 points, while participants gave public buses a higher score of 60.9 points, up 4.1 per cent. 

In addition, the MRT sub-sector also saw higher scores across both SMRT and SBS trains, notching an overall 62 points an increase of 3.7 per cent over 2014.

He claimed that the reason given was that the life company lacked the spare parts. He felt that this is not acceptable, and questioned the long wait for spare parts. Mr Kwok added there were no signs to indicate when the lift would be ready. He added that the delay has inconvenienced wheelchair users, the elderly, the infirm and pregnant ladies at the station, highlighting that the station is one of the busiest in Singapore. He urged the authority to ensure that all MRT stations are served by two lifts. "
SMRT Buses,Safety/Accident,Negative,"On 6 Sept around 12.24pm, the doors of SMRT bus service 860 had reportedly closed on a 15 year old student, Min Hui when she was boarding the bus, injuring her left leg. She says the bus driver had closed the doors on one of her legs as she was still boarding. He had looked toward her direction but did not seem to know that the student’s leg had been trapped. Instead, he tried closing the doors again, and Ming Hui had to pull her leg out. 

Ming Hui’s father, 50 year old Mr Tan, sought a clarification from the passenger service counter. He said he felt his complaint was not taken seriously and no apology was offered as the staff just handed him a form to fill in details of the incident. Mr Tan has since brought his daughter to lodge a police report, visited the doctor and intends to take legal action. While his daughter’s injuries are not serious, Mr Tan is worried that the consequences might have been different if an elderly or child was involved instead. He hopes to get an apology and compensation for how the company handled the matter. The article mentioned that they have contacted SMRT but have not received a response since. 

Note: CR has been in contact with Mr Tan. Most recent conversation was yesterday afternoon.

The bus driver then stood up and shouted to the rear of the bus in a friendly tone to inform a female passenger who was in her seventies, that she had arrived at her stop. The malay lady passenger, who needed help to alight due to the distance between the bus door and the ground, was assisted by passengers of different races and the bus driver who came forward to help. One of the passenger even carried the passenger down, and accompanied her to the interchange.

He highlighted that the queue for the service is always the longest, compared to other bus services. Despite his previous suggestion to SMRT for long-articulated buses to be used instead of the existing ones so that more passengers can be accommodated at any one time, but his proposal has not been implemented. Furthermore, there has not been noticeable improvements for service 858. Mr Teo also said that passengers continue to wait an inordinate amount of time for the bus, as they have over the past few years.

SMRT Corporate,Fines,Negative,"Rail operator SMRT Corp has been handed a $5.4 million fine for a massive breakdown that crippled the North-South and East-West Lines during the evening peak period on July 7. The amount is the biggest penalty imposed on a rail operator here so far, but is less than what some analysts were expecting. In announcing the penalty on Wednesday (Sept 23), LTA said the incident could have been prevented if SMRT had rectified the tunnel leak which was said to be the cause for the power trips along the entire network that evening.

LTA said SMRT was “fully responsible” for the incident and LTA CE intends to impose a high financial penalty on SMRT in light of the seriousness of the incident, and given that thousands of train commuters, as well as motorists and bus commuters were affected by this disruption. LTA said the fine will go into the Public Transport Fund to aid needy families cope with their transport expenditure.

Transport expert Lee Der-Horng told Lianhe Zaobao that although SMRT should be blamed for the incident, he noted that there are “inadequacies” in the design of the power system of NSEWL. He hopes that LTA will factor this into their considerations when calculating the fines to be imposed.

When asked if SMRT would pay up or appeal against the fine, SMRT VP CIC Mr Patrick Nathan would only say: “SMRT acknowledges the financial penalty. We have stepped up efforts to systematically address the issue and minimise the possibility of a recurrence.”

Forum,,,"These were the forum letters that were generated as the result of the news of the $5.4 million fine imposed on SMRT due to the 07 July incident.

Reader, V. Subramaniam, shared the latest fine on SMRT for a sum of $5.4 million for the major disruption of MRT services on July 7 and wondered if fines serve as any deterrence. He feels monetary penalties do not seem to ""motivate"" operators enough to do anything substantial about the frequent MRT breakdowns, adding that train operators need to ensure regular audits of the system in its entirety, so that hidden deficiencies can be rectified quickly. Finally, he believes that the existing model should be completely reviewed and revamped by the management of train operators and LTA, so that major train disruptions will be prevented.

Reader, Mohd Hamzah, feels the fine of $5.4 is just a fraction of SMRT’s net profit S$91 million for the financial year ended March. He thinks SMRT lacks in technical competence as it needed to import foreign expertise to help determine the root cause of the disruption on July 7. Despite the various issues, its management continues to be rewarded with high salaries. Therefore, he claimed that the responsible heads of departments should be closely scrutinised and their remunerations could be affected to push them to stay on their toes.

Reader, Thomas Lee Chee Chee, suggested the operator be required to run the affected lines for free for a period as the fine collected by LTA will not go towards compensating the affected commuters.

Reader, Patrick Tan Siong Kuan, claimed that the $5.4 million fine handed to SMRT will hardly hurt the train operator's bottom line. He added that fines can be classified as an operating expense and passed on to commuters as part of fare increases. He claimed that the root of problem lies with the MRT operating model, where the MRT system is run by a public-listed company, whose primary objective is profit maximisation for its shareholders. Therefore, repairing the tracks and electrical wiring may solve the technical problems, but does not solve the underlying problem.

Reader, Ong Soon Yam, claimed that the imposition of fines on public-listed companies providing public services is neither a preventive nor corrective measure to address maintenance issues and the possibility of future breakdowns. He says SMRT should put together a task force, if it has not already, comprising SMRT personnel from across various divisions and foreign experts, to scrutinise operational processes and provide recommendations to adopt corrective and preventive measures to minimise future breakdowns.

Reader, Ong Soon Yam, claimed that the imposition of fines on public-listed companies providing public services is neither a preventive nor corrective measure to address maintenance issues and the possibility of future breakdowns. He says SMRT should put together a task force, if it has not already, comprising SMRT personnel from across various divisions and foreign experts, to scrutinise operational processes and provide recommendations to adopt corrective and preventive measures to minimise future breakdowns.

Forum,,,"These were the forum letters that were generated as the result of the news of the $5.4 million fine imposed on SMRT due to the 07 July incident.

Reader, V. Subramaniam, shared the latest fine on SMRT for a sum of $5.4 million for the major disruption of MRT services on July 7 and wondered if fines serve as any deterrence. He feels monetary penalties do not seem to ""motivate"" operators enough to do anything substantial about the frequent MRT breakdowns, adding that train operators need to ensure regular audits of the system in its entirety, so that hidden deficiencies can be rectified quickly. Finally, he believes that the existing model should be completely reviewed and revamped by the management of train operators and LTA, so that major train disruptions will be prevented.

Reader, Mohd Hamzah, feels the fine of $5.4 is just a fraction of SMRT’s net profit S$91 million for the financial year ended March. He thinks SMRT lacks in technical competence as it needed to import foreign expertise to help determine the root cause of the disruption on July 7. Despite the various issues, its management continues to be rewarded with high salaries. Therefore, he claimed that the responsible heads of departments should be closely scrutinised and their remunerations could be affected to push them to stay on their toes.

Reader, Thomas Lee Chee Chee, suggested the operator be required to run the affected lines for free for a period as the fine collected by LTA will not go towards compensating the affected commuters.

Reader, Patrick Tan Siong Kuan, claimed that the $5.4 million fine handed to SMRT will hardly hurt the train operator's bottom line. He added that fines can be classified as an operating expense and passed on to commuters as part of fare increases.

SMRT Corporate,Labour,Neutral ,"For the first time since 2013, the air quality here has entered hazardous levels. As the haze steadily worsened yesterday, LTA slowed above-ground MRT train speeds between the Admiralty and Marsiling stations as a precaution against reduced visibility. While current public transport service levels have been maintained, public transport operators will activate their haze management plans if the situation worsens, LTA said. On the other hand, SBST and SMRT were noted to have issued N95 masks to their bus captains for their use, if necessary."
,,,"Reader, Leong Shin Loong, claimed that it is not fair to call SMRT technically incapable in the previous letter “SMRT lacks technical competence” (Sept 25) as the train system is a big and complex one. However, he wonders if the July breakdown incident was another sign that our train system is overloaded. Nonetheless, he believes SMRT made the right decision that night to halt services as safety should always come first without compromise. In addition, he claimed the S$5.4 million fine on SMRT for the disruption would be better used if it went towards servicing the trains."
SMRT Corporate,Labour,Positive ,"As the haze situation worsens in Singapore, the government has started distributing free masks to eligible Singaporeans to help fight the haze. LTA revealed that it would introduce haze management countermeasures if the situation worsens.

N95 masks were also issued by SBST and SMRT to bus captains for their use, if necessary. They were also reminded to practice cautious driving when the visibility is low."

The research group maintains that higher rail maintenance costs, dismal FY2016 growth and the low possibility of rail financing framework reforms any time soon could drag SMRT's share price.

In a blog post, he noted that while the situation in Singapore has improved in recent years, it is “still not good enough”. He added, “The consensus view is that we have underinvested in rail maintenance, and our engineering capabilities in this are still lacking. We will need to ramp up investment in this area. We will need to recruit and retain more skilled workers.”

Mr Khaw said he has asked PUB chairman Tan Gee Paw to be his Adviser on Rail Transformation.

Mr Khaw said he has asked PUB chairman Tan Gee Paw to be his Adviser on Rail Transformation. SIM University’s Adjunct Associate Professor Park Byung Joon said the MTR is older than the MRT, yet it is more reliable. “My personal opinion is that the MTR Corporation has a mindset geared towards achieving engineering excellence.

SMRT Corporate,Customer Satisfaction,Neutral ,"Customer satisfaction in Singapore’s land transport systems has risen this year and the survey reveals positive link between satisfaction levels and government intervention in the sector. According to the 2015 Q2 Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG) conducted by the Institute of Service Excellence at the SMU (ISES), land transport sub-sectors (MRT System, Public Buses and Taxi Services) posted an improvement in customer satisfaction scores.  Dr Marcus Lee, ISES academic director and assistant professor of marketing at SMU said that the observation suggests that customer satisfaction with our public transport operators is multi-faceted and improving satisfaction will take more than reliable trains and frequent buses. He pointed out that operators will need to have in place a collaborative and integrated strategy to improve the commuting experience, on that has the commuting public vested in the improvements and supported by government agencies.

SMRT “places strong emphasis on commuter experience.” Mr Patrick Nathan, Vice President of Corporate Information and Communications at SMRT said: “Our commitment to service excellence is a cornerstone of the multi-year, multi-project effort in renewing our North-South East-West Lines to achieve better levels of safety, reliability, convenience and comfort for our commuters.”

“We are encouraged to see improvements in the customer satisfaction results for our taxi, bus and train services but we realise there is still more to be done,” said Ms Tammy Tan, Group Corporate Communications Officer of ComfortDelGro. Ms Tan added that the company will continue in its efforts to do even more through continued investments in its taxi booking services, new buses, training, systems and processes.

SMRT's recent announcement that it will work with OMGTEL (OMG) to bid for Singapore's fourth wireless telecommunications carrier licence is among the many topics to be discussed during Monday's sitting of Parliament. Member of Parliament Baey Yam Keng (Tampines) will ask if SMRT's public transport services could be affected if the bid was successful, and whether the government would consider imposing conditions to ensure that the public interest in the provision of public transport services would not be compromised.

Forum,,,"In response to the letter ""Fines not the answer to MRT breakdowns"" by Dr V. Subramaniam on Sept 25, reader Paul Chan agrees that large fines on train operators will not solve the fundamental problem behind the recent breakdowns, which would be poor operating efficiency. He highlighted the decline of on-time performance across the North-South and East-West lines over the past 5 years in SMRT's 2014 annual report, adding that this comes despite constant assurances from SMRT that measures have been taken to improve rail network performance. The reader feels that a more comprehensive solution is needed. 

The reader believes in investing in competent manpower and equipment and compromising on service quality and efficiency is unwise. He urged for SMRT to review areas to minimise ""missing links"" on top of boosting manpower and enhancing training to ensure tasks are carried out properly. 

He has also suggested for the LTA to reconsider the operating model of the rail system, and in the meantime engage independent metro system experts and rail equipment suppliers to form a troubleshooting team, scrutinising the current system and implementing more effective preventive maintenance regimes.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Positive ,"All bus rides will be free in the event of a network-wide rail disruption like the one on July 7. These free rides will include those on private buses, which will be roped in to help in such large-scale breakdowns. 

LTA is working on ways to make fare refunds in the aftermath of such disruptions easier, and on a mobile phone app to disseminate information to commuters as quickly and as clearly as possible. Special shuttle bus services will be activated in addition to the usual bus bridging services when services on multiple rail lines are disrupted. These services will ply four routes, in a loop: Jurong East- Choa Chu Kang, Buona Vista – Boon Lay, Bishan – Woodlands, and Paya Lebar – Tampines. LTA CE said these routes were chosen to bring people home, mostly to the heartlands, from major interchange stations. He expects that this can help disperse the crowd quite effectively. 

Beacon lights at bus stops near MRT stations will also be installed to alert bus drivers and commuters of a breakdown and indicate that regular bus services will be free. So far, four such lights have been installed at two bus stops near Tiong Bahru MRT station and the rest will be rolled out over the course of the next year or so. 

LTA revealed these at a joint exercise with SMRT and SBS Transit on Wednesday (Oct 14) to test an enhanced incident management plan. These new steps were introduced following the July 7 incident, which crippled both the NSEW lines during the evening peak period and affected more than 400,000 passengers. 

ST highlighted that SMRT was fined a record $5.4 million for the incident, which arose because of inadequate maintenance. LTA is studying ways to prevent a repeat of a network-wide disruption, including physically separating the NSEW lines so that an electrical fault does not spread across both lines

LTA revealed these at a joint exercise with SMRT and SBS Transit on Wednesday (Oct 14) to test an enhanced incident management plan. These new steps were introduced following the July 7 incident, which crippled both the NSEW lines during the evening peak period and affected more than 400,000 passengers.

SMRT Trains,Delay/Disruption,Positive ,"Commuters are glad train operators were drawing up new measures to help passengers during large-scale breakdowns, which they noted were becoming more commonplace. LTA will activate special bus services, laid on by public as well as private bus operators, in the event of multiple line-wide service disruptions. The extra buses will boost current bus-bridging services offered by SMRT and SBS Transit to ferry stranded passengers to key interchange stations and major town centres.

Some commuters were interviewed by ST on their opinion of these new measures – some felt that they are glad that resources (help from private bus firms) are being roped in to help during disruptions. One felt that more could be done to reduce the hassle of getting a refund and another felt that operators need to know how to manage the passengers’ emotions during such disruptions.

SMRT Trains,Safety/Accident,Neutral ,"A woman known as Cyntalia Cipto left a comment on SMRT's Facebook page yesterday, as she was enraged the train door's sensor did not work and clamped shut on her. She claimed other passengers said worse incidents have occurred before. 
SMRT assured the passenger that stringent operational procedures are in place to ensure passenger safety. When the dwell time is due and before the doors are closed, a chime, door closing announcement and a buzzer are played to alert passengers of the impending closure of the doors. As a visual reinforcement, there are also red flashing lights above platform screen doors or Half Height Platform Screen Doors. Train doors and platform screen doors are designed with a built-in safety feature, which will not permit a train to move off unless all the doors are detected by the door sensors to be closed and locked. In addition, when the train doors are not fully closed, an indicator in the driving cabin will light up, prompting the train officer to re-open the train doors. Trains doors are also pneumatically operated such that the closing speed of the doors is reduced when they are about to close. 

The affected passenger did not respond to Shin Min queries by press time.

SMRT Corporate,Facilities & Services,Neutral,"Senior Transport Correspondent, Christopher Tan, suggested several issues necessary for Singapore to achieve a lower reliance on cars as stated by new transport minister Khaw Boon Wan. First, the public transport network has to be strengthened, where Minster Khaw already announced plans to up the engineering expertise here to tackle the reliability issues faced by the rail network. Second, infrastructure investments must keep to the target of doubling the rail network by 2030 regardless of financial crisis or economic uncertainties. Third, the plan to shift to a new rail financing framework needs more momentum as both SBS Transit and SMRT Corp have not been persuaded to shift the operating contracts of their older lines over to the new framework. Fourth, the need to revisit the proposal to have one rail operator for better economies of scale, and pooling of expertise as well as domain and institutional knowledge. Fifth, a need to empower regulators to have a stronger hold of that operator and having effective regulation for the new bus operating model. In addition, the ERP, COE systems and new expressways also need to be reviewed to optimise efficiency and capacity on the roads. Finally, there is a need to fix the taxi industry and the competitive from third-party private car booking apps."

SMRT Trains,Facilities & Services,Neutral,"Reader, Wong Boon Hong, indicates three problems about the driverless train system in the Circle Line. First, the train door doesn't have response system and always closes too quickly when the crowd is still alighting. Second, the train door doesn't reopen upon hitting something, and does not close with less force when the gap becomes narrower. Third, though it's good for the driverless system to shorten the interval to save time. However, many passengers have no sufficient time to alight and are forced to alight at the next station. In other words, it costs passengers more time."

Among the 12 packages under the new contracting framework, 3 of them will be opened for tender while the other 9, or 80%, of them will be operated by SBS Transit and SMRT until all are integrated into the new bus contracting model. The new contracting model not only broke the monopolistic positions of SBS Transit and SMRT but also introduced intense competition to the market. On one hand, the competition provides better work remuneration packages for employees and government could also gain from the lowest bids. However, there are risks involved in the new bus contracting model and there is a need to ensure its sustainability in the long run. First, these bus operators must be profitable to provide the motivation and resources to further improve services. Next, the proportion between collected transport fares and public transport expenditure must be maintained to prevent increasing financial deficit. Therefore, it is critical for authorities to evaluate bus operators during the bidding phase to prevent sudden bankruptcy of the companies and avoid any unnecessary disruptions to local public bus transport system."

He highlighted that a breakdown on an MRT line easily impacts tens of thousands of people and various areas of the nation. On the other hand, he noted on Mr Chew's correct comment that SMRT was able to recover from the situation quickly.

SMRT Trains,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"In response to the major MRT breakdown along NS Line yesterday morning, NUS Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Prof Lee Der-Horng, compared the local transport woes to that of an elderly, who is prone to illness. He claimed that minor hiccups in the rail system are still expected even though SMRT has long started efforts to upgrade local MRT system. However, he added that it is critical for SMRT to improve its contingency plans during breakdowns such as having not enough shuttle buses. In addition, he also advocated for authorities to standardise the signboards and increase public's awareness towards them. On the other hand, Ang Hin Kee, deputy chairman of Transport Government Parliamentary Committee, believed the MRT staffs had improved in their handling of breakdowns and the public had also been more understanding. He indicated that the MRT station staffs, who had undergone training, were faster in guiding commuters to the pick up points of shuttle buses during the breakdown yesterday."

The service disruption lasted 3.5 hours and affected over 413,000 commuters. The full service breakdown was the worst disruption in local history and the first involving two major lines. Investigation later found SMRT to be responsible for the negligence over maintenance works as the water leakage in the tunnel, which contaminated the third rail insulator and resulting in power trips, was not timely repaired. SMRT was fined S$5.4 million by LTA and was the highest fine recorded after the S$2 million fine on SMRT in 2011 over another two major breakdowns."

SMRT Trains,General / Others,Neutral,"Reader, Jin Zhi Yan, has observed a human jam at the busy Tampines MRT station. She shared two reasons for such a phenomenon. First, long queue slows down the speed of movement as people tend to wait for escalators rather than walking up stairs. Second, some people tends to stand on the right side of the escalators and blocking the way for people to move. Besides, as residential housing and malls increase near MRT stations, and the increase frequency of trains, human jam will definitely happen more frequently as well. Therefore, she hopes SMRT could ease the jam in this station and other big stations as well."
SMRT Trains,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"In response to the high frequency of MRT breakdowns, reader, V. Subramaniam highlighted that the problem stems from poor maintenance and neglect over the years. He added that the recurring disruptions indicate a systemic and structural problem with the operations as a whole. He urged SMRT to have management controls put in place. For instance, regular audits of the system in its entirety should also be carried out periodically, so that hidden deficiencies can be fixed. He believes a responsible public transport operator like SMRT has a duty to be accountable to commuters because frequent disruptions to rail operations have created a crisis of confidence among the travelling public."

SMRT Trains,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"Zaobao journalist, Li Jingyi, shared the recent announcement by Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan for LTA, which is currently handling design and construction of trains, to be capable of operating and maintaining MRT services. This is a shift towards an integrated organisation that could handle all aspects of MRT services as compared to the existing shared responsibilities between LTA and SMRT or SBS Transit. Despite the speculations on the government's attempt to nationalise public transport, writer claimed that the government is more likely to nationalise the rail assets under the Rail Financing Network while leaving the operation to contracted operators. She added that the new model is unlikely to be piloted on East West and North South lines operated by SMRT as the contracts only expire on 2028 but it might be trialed on the new lines such as Thomson East Coast Line."

At Farrer Park station, he was told by a uniformed MRT official that it is illegal to suck on ice cubes the moment he step onto MRT premises. Since there are in-station mall space to food sellers who offer dine-in services and food outlets at several stations, it seems reasonable to assume that when you go into a station, it is only in the area beyond the fare gates that eating and drinking are not allowed.

SMRT Corporate,Labour & Union,Neutral,"The commentary post cited the recent announcement by SMRT to offer an employee referral and signing-on bonus of up to S$3,000 and highlighted the challenge of manpower shortage in the local public transport sector. The shortage is mainly attributable to the lack of interest in the job from Singaporeans, the increasing demand from local public transport network expansions and also the competition from new bus operators like Tower Transit that offers better remuneration packages. The urgent demand for manpower was also evident from the frequent rail breakdowns, hence, the suggestion to set up a National Rail Academy. However, the key to attracting employees into the public transport sector are the salary and working conditions. Therefore, the recent competition by operators to hire employees through better remuneration packages could help attract more people into the sector. Nonetheless, the operators have to avoid losing control in manpower hiring as it would result in a rising cost, which would eventually be paid by commuters and the government."

This could both save the energy to find a suitable employee as well as enhance greater job satisfaction among the existing ones. However, the recruitment of bus drivers might be tougher owning to its long working hours and perceived hardship. Moreover, Singapore School and Private Hire Bus Owners' Association vice-president Neo Thiam Beng said that bus drivers might not jump ship since staying in their existing company will earn more money. But other than the incentive of money, some new transport industry player is dangling attractive benefits. For instance, Tower Transit provides their female staff 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, which is more than the 16 weeks offered by most employers. Furthermore, it also offers job redesign for bus captains, removing work such as refuelling, cleaning and parking of buses from their job scope. Therefore, these new factors might effect the employment landscape of the transport operation."

SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"Market analysts believe that land transport shares in the new year would be promising despite the series of breakdowns in 2015 such as the massive July 7 breakdown. For instance, SMRT shares dropped sharply by 8.7% after the July 7 breakdown and closed at S$1.41 on 31 Dec, 4.7% lower in the year of 2015. On the other hand, SBS Transit closed at S$1.94 on 31 Dec, 13.8% higher in the year of 2015. Market is expecting the government to intervene and buy back rail assets from existing operators and have the latter operate on a contracting basis, similar to the bus contracting model. Therefore, SMRT and SBS Transit are expected to benefit from the sales of assets back to the government."

Moreover, the Government might provide greater clarity on the private car hire industry, which has seen a boom with the popularity of apps such as Uber and GrabCar, as well as the use of personal mobility devices such as e-scooters. Furthermore, new operators will step in this industry this year. These includes Tower Transit, which will run 26 services in the western part of the island, while Go-Ahead will handle 25 routes in the Pasir Ris and Punggol area, taking over from incumbents SBS Transit and SMRT. With these changes, commuters will surely enjoy different kinds of travel experience this year."

SMRT Corporate,Facilities & Services,Neutral,"With an abundance of ups and downs last year, experts suggests the authority to focus on tackling immediate and longer-term challenges this year. According to experts, there are three issues that should put more emphasis on, and one of them is the transportation. In transportation, three main issues are widely discussed, and they are the railway nationalization, bus operation and private car issue. As for railway nationalization, SBS and SMRT have been responsible for the daily operations and maintenance of trains, while LTA designs and builds the rail lines. However, some argue to nationalize the transportation section entirely while others disagree on a bigger government intervention. In the bus industry, the shortage of manpower is still a big issue. As for the taxi industry, policymakers have yet to fully grapple with the rise of private-car sharing mobile applications. Experts suggest the authority should look into this issue. Otherwise, the taxi industry might not survive well."

However, he mentioned three problems during the train disruption. First, many of the shuttle bus drivers did not know the proper MRT bus bridging route between Kranji and Sembawang stations. Since bus captains had been instructed by SMRT staff to simply ""follow the bus in front"", buses were getting lost when the convoy got split at a traffic light. Second, there were instances of miscommunication among SMRT staff, one example being seen at the Woodlands Bus Interchange, where SMRT staff said the bridging route went all the way to Yishun when the official statement by SMRT and the LTA stated that the shuttle route ended at Sembawang. Finally, signs for the shuttle bus boarding points for commuters were also unclear, stating only that the bridging service could be boarded at the bus interchange, instead of specifying which berth. In a nutshell, he suggests SMRT that more contingency exercises should be conducted in separate stages along the entire rail network."

Though expenses inched up by 2.4 per cent to $303 million for rising staff and maintenance costs, they were partially offset by lower power and fuel costs. The following are the balance of SMRT's payment. First comes the MRT, its operation posted a 203.3 percent rise in operating profit to $9.7 million while losses at its LRT business widened by 89.7 percent to $1.5 million. Next comes with bus operation, it went from an operating loss of $462,000 to a profit of $3.4 million. Finally, its taxi business has showed the biggest improvement, with operating profit soaring by more than 500 percent to $4.8 million.

Accordingly, it had borrowings amounting to $810.5 million, down from $821.6 million. Its net gearing remained unchanged at 0.77. For the first nine months, the transport-based group's net earnings grew 17.9 percent to S$82.7 million. Revenue grew 7.1 percent to $1.03 billion. If the performance is sustained in the final quarter, SMRT is likely to garner its best full-year results since 2012."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"RHB was surprised by SMRT's Q3FY16 results. Expansion of operating margin for taxi business and positive operating margin for bus business in 9MFY16, with a strong improvement in train operating margin in Q3FY15, were key to its profit growth. In addition to lower fuel costs and higher ridership, expansion of bus and train operating margins were aided by training grants and funding from Public Transport Security Committee respectively. Therefore, SMRT could generate S$207 million of cash inflow from the sale of non-bus service enhancement program buses at 10 percent discount to book value to LTA. Furthermore, SMRT has progressed in its talks with LTA on the transition to a new rail-financing framework. Confirmation of this transition would re-rate the stock. Under such circumstance, they estimate the sale of rail assets at a 10 percent discount to book value in FY19 could add S$0.50 to our TP."

SMRT Trains,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,SMRT has introduced the use of fixed gantry cranes in the replacement of sleepers along the East-West line (EWL). The cranes which are about 20m in height and weigh 74 tonnes are used to hoist the Road Rail Vehicles (RRV) as well as the sleepers from the ground on to the tracks. The cranes allow the vehicles to be deployed more quickly to the work front and allowing more current wooden sleepers to be replaced with concrete ones. There are currently two gantry cranes used for this purpose including one at the line extension after the Pasir Ris MRT station while the other will be used to replace sleepers between Jurong East and Boon Lay stations.

SMRT Corporate,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"The share price of SMRT has significantly outperformed the broader Singapore market, rising 6.3 per cent this year to date, while ST1 recorded a substantial 12 percent decline over the same period. Revenue grew 4.6 percent year on year with growth across most business segments, while profit after tax and minority interests jumped 63.5 percent as operating expenses grew at a slower pace on cheaper energy costs. But still, while SMRT has stated progress is being made on rail reform, clarity is needed over the timeline and structure of reform. On its operations, an unexciting growth outlook is expected in the near term due to management-guided fall of $5 million to $6 million in fourth-quarter revenue. This is a result of the potential rider cannibalisation from the launch of Downtown Line 2, and 1.9 percent fare reduction. Cost pressures may continue to mount, especially for repair and maintenance expenses as well as staff costs. Management has guided for rail-related maintenance expenses to increase further to 50 percent of rail revenue."

Ten minutes later, he tapped the girl's knee with his fingers and stroked it. Fearful, the student moved closer to the window, away from him. But Ong held the girl by her waist and hugged her. For outraging the modesty of a person under 14, Ong could have been jailed for five years, fined, caned, or received any combined punishment.

SMRT Corporate,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"The Edge Singapore claimed SMRT's problem is that it cannot generate enough revenue to cover its rail operating expenses (opex). Therefore, some bold moves are needed at LTA to address the concerns. The Edge Singapore said SMRT's bottom line improvement last year has come from a property tax refund of $19 million relating to over-assessment in prior years. Excluding this sum, earnings would have declined 0.8% to $90.3 million. In addition, fare revenue risk is another concern for the new rail financing framework (NRFF) as the existing fare revenue from Public Transport Council is based on a formula that only takes into account inflation, wages and energy costs. The formula does not adjust for a disproportionate rise in maintenance-related expenses. SMRT president and group CEO Desmond Kuek also said he hopes the NRFF will include an element to manage the risk of fare revenue. However, analysts do not seem optimistic about SMRT's chances of swinging a winning deal. First, the local rail industry is expected to take a few more years before a full transition to government contracting model. Second, commuters may protest against a framework that allows SMRT to make money while putting the burden of subsidy on taxpayers. Finally, SMRT is also expected to generate less revenue owing to cannibalisation of ridership as new lines are built, but continue to incur higher expenses associated with running and maintaining this line."

But shorter licensing terms — 15 years, instead of 30 to 40 — means increased contestability, which could even see foreign players entering the market to provide services. Under the new rail financing framework, SMRT will be able to achieve an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin of about 5 per cent. SMRT can also focus on improving its services and its revenue."
SMRT Trains,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"SMRT painted a picture on Friday (July 15) of its possible financial woes should it continue operating under the current rail operations framework. SMRT CEO Desmond Kuek said SMRT currently faces three challenges under the existing financing framework. The first is heavy capital expenditure due to an ageing rail network, with costs expected to increase over the next five years. Second, the shortfall from rail fare and the commuter concessions, absorbed by SMRT since Financial Year (FY) 2001, totalled S$1.2 billion and S$700 million, respectively. Lastly, SMRT is also faced with increased maintenance and operational costs, reaching S$693 million in FY16 — an increase from S$662 million in the previous financial year."
SMRT Trains,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan believes the new rail financing framework will benefit commuters with an increased rail reliability and reduced crowding. Under the new framework, Land Transport Authority (LTA) could add trains to respond more quickly to demand, and to replace and upgrade existing rail assets in a more timely manner. The new framework was first implemented for SBS Transit's Downtown Line. On the other hand, SMRT is expected to get an Ebit margin of 5 per cent on average, compared with the more than 15 per cent it has been getting on average in the last five years. But it will be compensated with a release from capital expenditure."

SMRT Trains,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"While Temasek Holdings is said to be considering a buyout of SMRT - just days after the Government announced it will take over the transport operator's rail assets - it is unlikely to be a move towards nationalisation, said analysts. This is because the Government intends to keep the rail market contestable and to retender the operation of rail lines more often, they pointed out. SIM University economist Walter Theseira said: ""For nationalisation to occur, SMRT will have to be delisted and turned into a statutory corporation under the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) or Ministry of Transport's control. Yesterday, sources said that Temasek, which owns 54 per cent of SMRT, is considering an offer to buy out the transport operator and take it private. The firm is valued at close to $2.4 billion.

In the case of SMRT, being a private company can remove the need to juggle opposing interests and the tension from the ground for enriching shareholders at the expense of commuters. On the other hand, some cons of delisting would include to have taxpayers subsidise services used by the masses, instead of the shareholders. Moreover, the quality of rail service might not necessarily improve as much of it depends also on how well the system is designed and built in the first place."

SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"THE S$1.2 billion takeover offer for SMRT by Temasek has raised questions about the motive behind the exercise. This offer comes barely a week after the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced plans to take over SMRT's rail assets for almost S$1 billion. The state usually steps in when a company of national interest has tried ways to salvage itself, to no avail. Consider the case of Malaysia Airlines in 2014, or the bailout of financial institutions like AIG, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch in the 2007-2009 subprime mortgage crisis. The Singapore investment firm owns about 54 per cent of SMRT. Te-masek holds substantial stakes in companies which are considered of critical importance to Singapore: it has a 77 per cent stake in SIA Engineering, 56 per cent in Singapore Airlines, 52 per cent in Olam, 51 per cent in ST Engineering, 51 per cent in Singtel, and 49 per cent in Sembcorp Industries."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"The outcome of Temasek's proposed privatisation of SMRT now hinges on the firm's 49,000 shareholders, many of whom are retail investors. Temasek's success in bid requires a majority of shareholders to be present at a meeting and a vote of at least 75 per cent of the value of SMRT shares held by all investors at the meeting. The vote will be called by October. Temasek, which already holds 54 per cent of SMRT, will not be able to vote at this meeting. Neither can it raise its price and if the offer fails, SMRT will remain listed and Temasek will have to wait a year to try again. However, Temasek's buyout structure is called a scheme of arrangement and means the potential buyer will get all of the company or see its bid fall through. SMRT chief executive Desmond Kuek said the deal is structured this way because Temasek is already a majority shareholder in SMRT and is not looking to raise its stake."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"Christopher Tan, Straits Times Senior Transport Correspondent, said it was puzzling that SMRT said it had not thought about the savings it would achieve from a delisting. In addition, the comments made by both Temasek and SMRT during a joint briefing seemed to talk down the valuation of SMRT. In general, the buyout offer for a 46 per cent stake in SMRT at $1.68 is a 15 per cent premium over its 52-week average price. However, the writer believes it is the valuation might be different if the history of SMRT's performance and other factors such as impact of new rail financing framework were taken into consideration. On the other hand, the writer claimed it is equally puzzling with Temasek's scheme of arrangement offer to SMRT, which is often associated with mergers or the restructuring of a troubled entity. Moreover, the groups's offer with a total consideration worth $1.1 billion also coincides with the sum that the Government has agreed to pay for SMRT's operating assets."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"Financial analysts, unionists and other transport industry officials have generally welcomed Temasek Holdings' offer to take SMRT private. Temasek said last night that neither SMRT's management team nor its workforce would be affected by the change in control. National Transport Workers' Union executive secretary Melvin Yong also noted on SMRT's assurance that ""no staff will lose his or her job"". On the other hand, Workers' Party questioned if Temasek's buyout of SMRT might result in none of the benefits of nationalisation, while SMRT's financials and operations may become less transparent to the public."

Even with the announcement and eventual transition to the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), it is expected that SMRT's outlook will still face uncertainties. The offer price of S$1.68 equates to 29 times/36 times 2017/18 forecast earnings and about 2.7 times book."

SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"After the announcement of the new rail financing framework (NRFF), Temasek said it was clearer about the regulatory risks SMRT was facing, and that, as a 54-per-cent shareholder, it could now look at how best to bring SMRT forward, to help it ""focus"" in the long time. Aside from the long-term ideals, analysts noted that the expected returns of SMRT under NRFF's revenue shortfall-sharing and a profit-sharing mechanism might be able to provide a return at the upper end of the (Ebit) range. Moreover, Temasek is already prepared to stick up with SMRT's revenue and ridership risks in the long run. Finally, Temasek's efforts to help SMRT seem to have a strong link with Singapore's government with its latest buyout offer."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"SMRT shares jumped yesterday on the counter's first day of trading after a halt since last Friday was lifted, but remained below Temasek Holdings' offer price of $1.68. The stock opened at $1.66, up 7.44 per cent from its last trading price of $1.545, and closed at $1.64. Temasek owns 54 per cent of SMRT and had announced buyout plans on Wednesday. If successful, SMRT will be delisted. Financial analysts are recommending that retail investors accept Temasek's takeover offer. They say the $1.68 offer is a good chance for SMRT's 49,000 investors to exit in view of the new rail financing model and uncertainties over the firm's short-term outlook. The offer came after the Government announced a new rail financing framework (NRFF) last Friday."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"In response to Temasek Holdings' bid to take over SMRT and privatise the company, experts said SMRT would be a closely held firm that is not listed on the Singapore Exchange. Regardless, it is not a nationalisation because Temasek owns assets at arm's length from the Government. Temasek's takeover bid comes just five days after the Government announced that the Land Transport Authority would take over SMRT's operating rail assets, which had offered a similar valuation. On the other hand, Temasek and SMRT said in a joint statement on Wednesday that privatisation would provide SMRT ""greater flexibility to focus on its primary role of delivering safe and high-quality rail service, without short-term pressures of being a listed company""."

SMRT Trains,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"Christopher Tan, Straits Times Senior Transport Correspondent, shared about the shift of rail operations to a completely new financing framework and the delisting local main rail operator as a rare sight. Despite the daunting task of managing the interests of shareholders and commuters, Hong Kong's MTR Corp, which was listed in the same year as SMRT, has a better success by operating on a different model from SMRT's. The former is involved in building rail infrastructure and, in turn, is given development rights to properties along the metro lines. On the other hand, SMRT has to accord proceeds from property sales to the Government and kept in reserves for future generations. Nonetheless, the writer hopes SMRT can focus on serving commuters better when it comes without the burden of hefty capital expenditures."

SMRT Corporate,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"Commuters hoping to benefit from the potential privatisation of SMRT may be disappointed in the short-term, with analysts predicting little or no immediate impact in areas such as train reliability and frequency. However, in the long run commuters may see some benefits from the privatisation of SMRT, as this would would allow the company to concentrate on its core tasks - which are delivering reliable and efficient public transport services, rather than having to keep an eye on investors' priorities."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"Straits Times Index (STI) has gained 20 points or 0.7 per cent at 2,945.35, of which 4.87 points came on Friday. The most prominent corporate development was an offer for SMRT's shares by investment firm Temasek Holdings at S$1.68 per share. Temasek's offer was made via a scheme of arrangement rather than the more common general offer/takeover means, its rationale being that it wants to take SMRT private rather than increase its stake. Immediately upon resumption of trading on Thursday after Temasek's offer, SMRT's shares rose to S$1.645; and on Friday they ended unchanged at that level on volume of 19.3 million."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"Temasek Holdings' unit Belford Investments has said it does not intend to raise its offer price of $1.68 a share to buy out and delist SMRT. SMRT will be seeking regulatory approval to hold a meeting with shareholders, possibly by early October. The Straits Times understands a price revision is practically impossible for a scheme of arrangement. On the other hand, the New Rail Fincancing Framework model will see SMRT sell rail assets to the Government and operate on a licence-based model from Oct 1. The framework has a cap on earnings margin."
SMRT Corporate,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"The Straits Times shared a weekly round-up of the columns on news that matter. First, Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan observed that the new financial framework indicated that the local rail operator is facing challenges to juggle the interests of shareholders and commuters. But he noted that Hong Kong's MTR Corp, listed the same year as SMRT, managed the job on a different operating model and that perhaps there are lessons to be drawn there. Second, Malaysia Bureau Chief Shannon Teoh highlighted the significance and benefits of Singapore-KL high-speed rail project. Finally, Business reporter Grace Leong said that the SGX needs to give details on the latest breakdown and, more importantly, saywhat can be done to prevent more trading disruptions, so as to reassure investors."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"The Straits Times says questions will naturally arise in the public's mind about the Government's $1 billion purchase of rail operator SMRT's assets. Unlike Hong Kong's MTR that has been self-sustaining given the benefits of property-value gains in areas served by new lines, SMRT is faced with limits on fare increases set by the Public Transport Council and pressures of meeting shareholders' demands have contributed to spending constraints that have impacted services. Therefore, it believes nationalising rail transport is not the answer as the government should be maintaining the larger perspective and effectively ensuring private operators are on top of their game."
SMRT Buses,Labour & Union,Neutral,Sources claimed that several bus captains had taken leave on the 20th June to voice their unhappiness against the rotating shifts and work hours in Tower Transit company. These bus captains were reported to have crossed over from SBS Transit and SMRT company. The incident only lasted a day and some of those unhappy bus captains have expressed wish to return to their original bus companies.
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"Writer, Ye Pengfei, shared about the latest buyout offer from Temasek Holdings towards SMRT corporation and highlighted the confusion on the concept of entity for both organisations. Although Temasek is legally a registered company, its only shareholder is Finance Ministry. Hence, the writer claimed Temasek's acquisition of SMRT is equivalent to a move of making it a national asset. However, he also noted that the company would be given the freedom to run as a private entity. He believes it is a right move to delist SMRT but it is also equally important to describe the correct concept of entity for the company. It should no longer be a publicly listed company but its delisting is also not a privatisation."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"""We do not see that this is anywhere close to nationalisation. SMRT will still be run as a corporation. It's just that it is 100% owned by us,"" said Mr Chia Song Hwee, president of Temasek International, during a joint briefing by Temasek and SMRT. He stressed that the move is to relieve SMRT from the pressure of short-term profits and have it focus on providing quality services."
SMRT Corporate,Rail & Engineering,Neutral,"Following Temasek's buyout offer to privatise SMRT, all three sectors of air, land and sea transport shares in Singapore have been targeted for acquisition and delisting. In the land segment, SMRT corporation, which has been hit by a series of rail service disruptions, has reached an agreement with the government under the new rail financing framework (NRFF). Moreover, Temasek also made a buyout offer to delist SMRT and have it focused on long term goals. Although some shareholders were unhappy with the offered price, several analysts have urged them to accept the offer as SMRT might face another round of downgrade if remained on the listing. On the other hand, SMRT share price were noted to be below the offer price after it resumed trading two days ago."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"Writer, Lin Anna, shared about the news that Temasek Holdings has offered to buy out SMRT with S$1.18 billion. She believes it is a good thing if Temasek's acquisition of SMRT at S$1.68 per share becomes successful. She highlighted SMRT's dilemma as a listed company to maximise profits for shareholders, while fulfilling the responsibilities of a public service to society. On the other hand, she suggested that SMRT would be able to focus more on providing better services for the people once it got delisted and having Temasek as its sole shareholder."
SMRT Corporate,Facilities & Services,Neutral,"Reader, Lin Xiurong, believes some Singaporeans might not care about Temasek's buyout offer for SMRT as they would not know the exact changes from the deal. However, she claimed that all Singaporeans shared the same pragmatic hope towards Temasek's acquisition of SMRT, which is for Temasek to invest more into the rail system and maintenance regimes. In addition, they also hope that there would be no more breakdowns, disruptions or even a fare hike for the upcoming years."

SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"Even as SMRT Corp ends years of dismal financial performance as a public-listed company with a buyout offer from Temasek Holdings, SBS Transit, the 75%-owned subsidiary of ComfortDelGro Corp that operates local bus and train services, has seen its shares surge 32% since the beginning of the year. On the other hand, shares in SMRT are up 10% this year, partly thanks to the buyout offer at $1.68 a share announced by Temasek this past week. SBS Transit has not suffered from the loss of some of its bus routes and train operations have been a relatively small part of SBS Transit's revenue and earnings. The improving profitability at SBS Transit has been driven by cost savings and higher ridership on its buses and trains."
SMRT Corporate,Corporate & Financials,Neutral,"ComfortDelGro's taxi busines, which is a major contributor to its bottom line, is being threatened by the likes of Grab and Uber even as its train business faces the prospect of lower margins from the new rail financing framework. On July 15, LTA announced that SMRT Corp's rail business would be transiting to a New Rail Financing Framework. The NRFF caps the earnings potential of SMRT's rail business at 5% Ebit and the same is expected of SBS Transit. Despite calls for the need to change just like SMRT, analysts urged ComfortDelgro not to venture into the private hire car market for fear of cannibalising its current taxi business. Rather, the company should continue to incentivise taxi drivers to maintain full utilisation of its fleet. In April, SMRT launched its own private hire business called Strides. The business started out with limousine services using luxury vehicles and is progressively rolling out a fleet of Toyota Altis sedans to provide chauffeured and car rental services."
