    "sample_msg = u'Referring to the letters, \"Circle Line train incident: SMRT explains cause and steps taken\" and \"Commuters distressed and kept in the dark\", forum writer Larry Chong Tuck Lai asked several questions regarding the safety of passengers when there is smoke inside the train. These are the questions, assuming a fully packed peak-hour train: How much smoke is needed before the smoke detector is activated and the ventilation system shut? What happens after the ventilation system is shut? How long will the air supply last in a crowded train with no air-conditioning or ventilation and with the presence of smoke in the cabin? While the incident was resolved within five minutes, what happens if we have a case where staff are unable to reach the site of the breakdown for hours, and the system is not restored? What options are available to passengers trapped in the train? Are there manual systems to allow passengers to free themselves, or at least open windows to allow air to flow in?CIC/CMC is working with SMRT Trains to prepare a response.'\n",
